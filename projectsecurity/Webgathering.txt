\\Utilising Whois
\\scenarios 1: Phishing Investigation
- a security analyst investigation the email and begins by performing a WHOIS lookup on the domain linked in the email
it reveals :-Registration Data -Registrant -Name Servers: the name servers are associated with a known bulletproof hosting privider often used for malicious activities
- this combine of factors raises significant red flags for the analyst. the recent registration date,...
\\Scenario 2: Malware Analysis
during analysing a new strain of malware that has infected several sys within a network the malware comm with a remote server to receive commands and exfiltrate stolen data. to gain insight into the threat actor infra. 
the researcher perform a WHOIS lookup on the domain associated with the C2 server
it reveal: -Registrant -Locaion -Registrar
-based on this infor the researcher concludes that C2 server is likely hosted on a compromised or bulletproof server ->identify the hosting provider and notify them of the malicious activity 
\\Scenario 3: Threat Intelligence repositories
- track the activities of a sophisticated threat actor group known for targeting financial institutions, analysts gather WHOIS data on multiple domains associated with the group's past campaigns to compile a comprehensive threat intelligencereport
it reveal: -registration dates -registrants -Name Servers -Takedown History
-> allow analysts to create a detailed profile of te threat actor's tactics, techniques, procedures(TTPs) the report includes indicators of compromise(IOCs)
-> detect block future attack
\\Using WHOIS

\\\\\\\\\=================================
DNS
dns acts as the internet GPS, guiding from memorable landmarks to precise number coordinates.
\\how DNS works
1.comp query for DNS ->check cache -> DNS resolver. (ISP provider) 
2. DNS Resolver Checks its Map (Recursive Lookup): resolver also has a cache, and if it doesn;t find the IP addr there, it starts a journey through the DNS hierarchy. -> asking root name server (internet library)
3. Root Name Server Points the Way:-> doesnt know the exact addr but knows who doesn -> top-level (TLD) name server responsible for domains ending (eg,..com,.org) it points the resolver in the right direction.
4. TLD name server narrows it down(like a regional map) it know which authoritative name server is responsible for the specific domain you're looking for(Eg:exmple.com)
5.Authoritative name server delivers the addr: final stop, it's like the street address of the website you want. it hold the correct IP addr and sends it back to the resolver.
6 the DNS Resolver Returns the information: the resolver receives IP addr and gives it to comp it also remembers it for a while (cache it) 
7. comp connects -> start browsing
\\The Host File
is a simple text file used to map hostnames to IP addr, providing a manual method of domain name resolution that bypass the DNS process. while DNS automates the translation of domain names to IP addr, the hosts file allows for direct, local overrides. this can be particularly useful for deve troubleshotting or blocking website
-The hosts file is located in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts on Windows and in /etc/hosts on linux and MacOS, each line in the file follows the format:
<IP address>                <Hostname> [<Alias>...] 
127.0.0.1                   localhost
192.168.1.10                devserver.local
-commonly uses include redirecting a domain to a local server for development:
-testing connectivity by specifying an IP addr
192.168.1.20                testserver.local
-blocking unwanted websites by redirecting their domains to a non-existent IP addr
0.0.0.0                     unwanted-site.com
\\Replay reconnaissance
-think of the DNS process as a relay race. comp starts with the dn and passes it along the resolver, the resolve then passes the request to the root server, the TLD server, and finally, the authoritative server. each one getting closer to the destination. once the IP addr is found, it relayed back down the chain to your comp, allowing to access the website.
\\Key DNS Concepts
-in dns, a zone is a distinct part of the domain namespace that a specific entity or administrator manages.think of it as a virtual container for a set of domain names. 
EX example.com and all its subdomains(like mail.example.com or blog.example.com) would typically belong to the same DNS zone
-the zone file, a text file residing on a DNS server, defines the resource records (discussed bwlow) withing this zone, providing crucial infor for translating domain name in to IP addr
-to illustrate, here;s a simplified example of what a zone file, for Example.com might look like:
$TTL 3600 ; Default Time-To-Live (1 hour)
@       IN SOA   ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. (
                2024060401 ; Serial number (YYYYMMDDNN)
                3600       ; Refresh interval
                900        ; Retry interval
                604800     ; Expire time
                86400 )    ; Minimum TTL

@       IN NS    ns1.example.com.
@       IN NS    ns2.example.com.
@       IN MX 10 mail.example.com.
www     IN A     192.0.2.1
mail    IN A     198.51.100.1
ftp     IN CNAME www.example.com.
-this file defines the authoritative name servers (NS record), mail server (MX record), and IP addr (A record) for various hosts within the example.com domain.
-DNS  server store various resource records, each serving a specific purpose in the domain name resolution process 
DNS Concept	Description	Example
Domain Name	A human-readable label for a website or other internet resource.	www.example.com
IP Address	A unique numerical identifier assigned to each device connected to the internet.	192.0.2.1
DNS Resolver	A server that translates domain names into IP addresses.	Your ISP's DNS server or public resolvers like Google DNS (8.8.8.8)
Root Name Server	The top-level servers in the DNS hierarchy.	There are 13 root servers worldwide, named A-M: a.root-servers.net
TLD Name Server	Servers responsible for specific top-level domains (e.g., .com, .org).	Verisign for .com, PIR for .org
Authoritative Name Server	The server that holds the actual IP address for a domain.	Often managed by hosting providers or domain registrars.
DNS Record Types	Different types of information stored in DNS.	A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT, etc.

-fundamental concepts of DNS, dive deeper into the building blocks of DNS infor- the various record types. these record store diff types of data associated with domain names. each serving a specific purpose

ecord Type	Full Name	Description	Zone File Example
A	Address Record	Maps a hostname to its IPv4 address.	www.example.com. IN A 192.0.2.1
AAAA	IPv6 Address Record	Maps a hostname to its IPv6 address.	www.example.com. IN AAAA 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334
CNAME	Canonical Name Record	Creates an alias for a hostname, pointing it to another hostname.	blog.example.com. IN CNAME webserver.example.net.
MX	Mail Exchange Record	Specifies the mail server(s) responsible for handling email for the domain.	example.com. IN MX 10 mail.example.com.
NS	Name Server Record	Delegates a DNS zone to a specific authoritative name server.	example.com. IN NS ns1.example.com.
TXT	Text Record	Stores arbitrary text information, often used for domain verification or security policies.	example.com. IN TXT "v=spf1 mx -all" (SPF record)
SOA	Start of Authority Record	Specifies administrative information about a DNS zone, including the primary name server, responsible person's email, and other parameters.	example.com. IN SOA ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. 2024060301 10800 3600 604800 86400
SRV	Service Record	Defines the hostname and port number for specific services.	_sip._udp.example.com. IN SRV 10 5 5060 sipserver.example.com.
PTR	Pointer Record	Used for reverse DNS lookups, mapping an IP address to a hostname.	1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. IN PTR www.example.com.
-the IN stands for "Internet" it's a class field in DNS records that specifies the protocol family. in most cases, you;ll see "IN" used, as it denotes the internet protocol suite (IP used for most domain names.
-other class values exist (EG: CH for Chaosnet, HS for hesiod)) but are rarely used in morderm DNS config
-in essence"IN" is simply a convention that indicates that the record applies to the standard internet protocols we use today. while it might seem like an extra detail. understanding its meaning provides a deeper understanding of DNS record structure
\\Why DNS matters for web reconnaissance
it's a critical component of a target's infras that can be leveraged to uncover vul and gain access during a pentest 
+uncovering assets:reveak a wealth of infor, subdomain, mail server, anem name server record, EX: a cname record pointing to and outdated server (dev.example.com CNAME oldserver.example.net) could leak to a vulnerable system
+Mapping the network infras: create comprehensive map of the target network infrs by analysing DNS data. EX identifying the name server (NS records) which reveal hosting provider used, while an A record for loadbalancer.example.com can pinpoint a load balancer. ->understand diff system are connected, traffic flow, pinpoint potential choke points or weaknesses that could be exploited during a penetration test
+Monitoring for changes: continously monitoring DNS records can reveal changes in the target's infra over time. EX the sudden appearance of a new subdomain (VPN.example.com)might indicate a new entry point into the network, while a TXT record containing a value like _1password=... strongly suggests the org is using 1passowrd, which could be leveraged for social engineering attacks or targetd phishing campaigns.
\\\\\\\\\=================================
Digging DNS
having established a solid understanding of DNS fundamentals and its various record types, lets now transition to the practical. this section will explore the tools and techniques for leveraging DNS for WEB reconnaissance
\\DNS Tools

-caution: some servers can detect and block excessive DNS queries. use caution and respect rate limits always obtain permission before performing extensive DNS reconnaissance on the target
\\Groping DNS
$dig google.com
-result might be broken down into four key sections:
1.Header
-;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 16449 -> this indicates the type of query, the succesful status (NOERROR), and unique id for specific query
-;; flags: qr rd ad; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0: this describes the flags in the DNS header:
    +qr: Query Response flag - indicates this is a response.
    +rd: Recursive desired flag - means recursive was requested
    +ad: Authentic Data flag - means the resolver considers the data authentic.
    +the remaining numbers indicate the number of entries in each section of the DNS response:1 question, 1 answer, 0 authority records, and - additional records.
-;; WARNING: recursion requested but not available: This indicates that recursion was requested, but the server does not support it.
2. Question section
-google.com. IN A: this ........................
- an OPT pseudosection can sometimes exist in a dig query. this is dueto extention mechanisms for DNS (EDNS), which allows for additional features such as larger message sizes and DNS security extension(DNSSEC) support.
- get only answer 
$dig +short Hackthebox.com
<test>Which IP address maps to inlanefreight.com?
dig <url>
<test>Which domain is returned when querying the PTR record for 134.209.24.248?

<test>What is the full domain returned when you query the mail records for facebook.com?
dig <url> mx
\\\\\=====================================
subdomains
there a potential infor besite domain ->subdomain these are extensions of the main domain, often created to organise and separate different sections or functionalities of a website. 
EX: a company might use blog.example.com for its blog, shop.example.com for its online store, or mail.example.com for its email services
\\why it important
subdomains often host valuable infor and resources that aren't directly linked from the main website. this can include:
+development and staging environment: tesst dev might contain vulnerabilities or expose sensitive infor
+Hidden login portals
+legacy application: 
+sensitive information: it inadvertently expose confidential documents, internal data, or configuration files that could be valuable to attackers
\\Subdomain enumeration
-it is the process of systematically identifying and listing these subdomains, from a DNS perspective, subdomains are typically represented by A for AAAA for IPv6 record which map the subdomain name to its IP additonally.
CNAME records might be used to create aliases for sub, pointing them to other domains or sub. there are few main approaches to subdomain enum:
1. Active Subdomain enumeration
-directly interacting with the target domain DNS server to uncover sub. one method is attempting a DNS zone transfer, where a misconfigured server might inadvertently leak a complete list of sub. however, due to tightened security measures, this is rarely successful
-brute-force enumeration, which involves systematically testing a list of potential sub names agaisnt the target domain. Tools like dnsenum, ffuf, and gobuster
can automate this process, using wordlists of common sub names or custom-generated lists based on specific partterns
2. Passive subdomain enumeration
-one valuable resource is Certificate Transparency (CT) logs, public repositories of SSL/TLS cert. these cert often include a list of associated subdomains in their subject alternative name (SAN) field.
-search engine . (site: ,...)
\\\=========================
subdomain bruteforcing
1. wordlist selection: + General-purpose: broad range of common subdomain names (e.g:,dev,staging,blog,mail,admin,test) this useful when dont know the target;s naming conventions
+targetd: Focused on specific industries, technologies, or naming patterns relevant to the target. this approach is more efficient and reduces the chances of false positives.
+custom: you can create your own wordlist based on specific keywords, patterns, or intelligence gathered from other sources.
2.iteration and querying: A script or tool iterates through the wordlist, appending each word or phrase to the main domain (e.g example.com) to create potential subdomain names (e.g dev.ex.com, staging.ex.com)
3. DNS lookup: check if it resolves to an IP
4. filtering and validation: if a sub resolves successfuly, it's added to a list of valid subdomains. further validation steps might be taken to confirm the subdomain;s existence and functionality (e.g by attempting to access it through a web browser)

Tool	Description
dnsenum	Comprehensive DNS enumeration tool that supports dictionary and brute-force attacks for discovering subdomains.

$dnsenum --enum inlanefreight.com -f /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -r

\\=========================================
DNS Zone transfer
while bruteforcing theres less invasive and potentially more efficient method for uncovering sub -DNS zone transfers, this mechanism, designed for replicating DNS records between name servers, can inadvertently become a goldmine of information for prying eyes if misconfigured
\\Whhat is zone transfer
A DNS zone transfer is essentially a whole sale copy of all DNS records within a zone(adomain and its sub)
from one name server to another. this process is essential for maintaining consistency and redundancy across DNS servers.hwer if not adequately secured, unauthorised parties can download the entire zone file, revealing a complete list of subdomains, their associated IP addresses and other sensitive DNS data
-secondaryServer                    PrimaryServer
            FXFR Request (zone transfer)-->
        <-- SOA Record (start of authority) :contain vital infor about the zone, it serial num, which help the secondary server determine if its zone data is current
        loop        [transfer]     :transfer all the DNS records in ther zone to 2nd zone, A,AAAA,MX,Cname,NS,... other sub, mailserver,..
        <--         DNS record
        <--          Zone transfer complete
                ACK (Acknowledgement) -->

secondaryServer                     PrimaryServer
\\The Zone Transfer Vulnerability
while zone transfer are essential for legit DNS management, a misconfigured DNS server can transform this process into a significant security vulnerability.the core issues lies in the access controls governing who can initiate a zone transfer
-the infor gleaned from an unauthorised zone transfer can be invaluable to an attacker, it reveals a comprehensive map of the target's DNS infrastructure, inlcuding:
+subdomains: a complete list of subdomains + IP addr +name server records detail about the authoritative name servers for the domain, revealing the hosting provider and ptential misconfigurations.
+IP addr +name server records
\\Remediation
modern DNS svr are typically config to allow zone transfer only to trusted secondary svr. ensure zone data remains confidential
but smt human made ->wy a zonetransfer with proper authorisation remains a valuable reconnaissance technique. even if unsuccesful, the attempt can reveal information about the DNS server's config and security posture
\\Exploiting Zone transfers
$dig axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me 
this command instruct dig to request a full zone transfer (axfr) from dns svr responsible for zonetransfer.me if the svr is misconfig and allow transfer. we migh reveive a complete list of DNS records for the domain including all sub
$dig axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me 
zone transfer is a service specifically setup to demo the risk of zone transfer so that the dig command will return the axfr
<test>After performing a zone transfer for the domain inlanefreight.htb on the target system, how many DNS records are retrieved from the target system's name server? Provide your answer as an integer, e.g, 123.
$dig axfr <url> @<ip>
<test> Within the zone record transferred above, find the ip address for ftp.admin.inlanefreight.htb. Respond only with the IP address, eg 127.0.0.1
$dig axfr <url> @<ip> | grep "ftp.admin.inlanefreight.htb"
<test>Within the same zone record, identify the largest IP address allocated within the 10.10.200 IP range. Respond with the full IP address, eg 10.10.200.1
$dig axfr <url> @<ip> | grep "10.10.200"
