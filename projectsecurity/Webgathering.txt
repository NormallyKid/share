\\Whois
query and response protocol designed to access db that store infor about registered internet resource.it also provide detail about IP, blocks and autonomous systems
$whois <domainname>
\\GDPR general data protection regulation 
Whois are underway to strike a balance through initiatives like the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) which offers a more granular and privacy-conscious approach to accessing domain registration data

\\Utilising Whois
\\scenarios 1: Phishing Investigation
- a security analyst investigation the email and begins by performing a WHOIS lookup on the domain linked in the email
it reveals :-Registration Data -Registrant -Name Servers: the name servers are associated with a known bulletproof hosting privider often used for malicious activities
- this combine of factors raises significant red flags for the analyst. the recent registration date,...
\\Scenario 2: Malware Analysis
during analysing a new strain of malware that has infected several sys within a network the malware comm with a remote server to receive commands and exfiltrate stolen data. to gain insight into the threat actor infra. 
the researcher perform a WHOIS lookup on the domain associated with the C2 server
it reveal: -Registrant -Locaion -Registrar
-based on this infor the researcher concludes that C2 server is likely hosted on a compromised or bulletproof server ->identify the hosting provider and notify them of the malicious activity 
\\Scenario 3: Threat Intelligence repositories
- track the activities of a sophisticated threat actor group known for targeting financial institutions, analysts gather WHOIS data on multiple domains associated with the group's past campaigns to compile a comprehensive threat intelligencereport
it reveal: -registration dates -registrants -Name Servers -Takedown History
-> allow analysts to create a detailed profile of te threat actor's tactics, techniques, procedures(TTPs) the report includes indicators of compromise(IOCs)
-> detect block future attack
\\Using WHOIS
$sudo apt update -> $sudo api install whois -y
$whois facebook.com
-> domain registration -Domain Owner - Domain status -Nameserver suggest companay manage it DNS infra
