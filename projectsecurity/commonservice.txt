\\Interacting with COmmon Services
Vulnerabilities are commonly discovered by people who use and understand technology, a protocol, or a service. As we evolve in this field, we will find different services to interact with, and we will need to evolve and learn new technology constantly.

To be successful at attacking a service, we need to know its purpose, how to interact with it, what tools we can use, and what we can do with it. This section will focus on common services and how we can interact with them.
\\File Share Services
\\Server Message Block (SMB)
\\Windows \\192.168.1.1\share
Windows has two command-line shells: the Command shell and PowerShell. Each shell is a software program that provides direct communication between us and the operating system or application, providing an environment to automate IT operations.
\\Windows CMC-Director
The command net use connects a computer to or disconnects a computer from a shared resource or displays information about computer connections. We can connect to a file share with the following command and map its content to the drive letter n.
\\Window CMD - Net use
$>net use n: \\192.168.1.1\share
$>net use n: \\192.168.1.1\share /user:plaintext Password123
With the shared folder mapped as the n drive, we can execute Windows commands as if this shared folder is on our local computer. Let's find how many files the shared folder and its subdirectories contain.
\\Window CMD - Dir 
$dir n: /a-d /s /b | find /c ":\"
Syntax	Description
dir	Application
n:	Directory or drive to search
/a-d	/a is the attribute and -d means not directories
/s	Displays files in a specified directory and all subdirectories
/b	Uses bare format (no heading information or summary)
$dir n:\*cred* /s /b 
n:\Contracts\private\credentials/txt
$dir n:\*secret* /s /b n:\Contracts\private\secret.txt
-If we want to search for a specific word within a text file, we can use findstr.

\\Windows CMD - Findstr
$findstr /s /i cred n:\*.*

\\Windows Powershell
PowerShell was designed to extend the capabilities of the Command shell to run PowerShell commands called cmdlets. 
-Cmdlets are similar to Windows commands but provide a more extensible scripting language. We can run both Windows commands and PowerShell cmdlets in PowerShell, but the Command shell can only run Windows commands and not PowerShell cmdlets. Let's replicate the same commands now using Powershell.

\\Windows PowerShell 
$Get-ChildItem \\192.168.1.1\Share\
-instead of net use we can use New-PSDrive in PowerShell
$New-PSDrive -Name "N" -Root "\\192.168.1.1\share" -PSProvider "FileSystem"
To provide a username and password with Powershell, we need to create a PSCredential object. It offers a centralized way to manage usernames, passwords, and credentials.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.pscredential?view=powershellsdk-7.4.0

\\Windows PowerShell - PSCredential Object
$username = 'plaintext'
$password = 'Password123'
$secpassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -force
$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $secpassword
$New-PSDrive -Name "N" -Root "\\192.168.1.1\share" -PSProvider "FileSystem" - Credential $cred
We can use the property -Include to find specific items from the directory specified by the Path parameter.

$Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path N:\ -Include *cred* -File
-The Select-String cmdlet uses regular expression matching to search for text patterns in input strings and files. We can use Select-String similar to grep in UNIX or findstr.exe in Windows.

\\Windows PowerShell - Select-String
$Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path N:\ | Select-String "cred" -list
CLI enables IT operations to automate routine tasks like user account management, nightly backups, or interaction with many files. We can perform operations more efficiently by using scripts than the user interface or GUI.

\\Linux
Linux (UNIX) machines can also be used to browse and mount SMB shares. Note that this can be done whether the target server is a Windows machine or a Samba server. Even though some Linux distributions support a GUI, we will focus on Linux command-line utilities and tools to interact with SMB. Let's cover how to mount SMB shares to interact with directories and files locally.

\\Linux-Mount
$sudo mkdir /mnt/Finance
$sudo mkdir /mount -t cifs -o username=plaintext,password=Password123,domain=.//192.168.1.1/finance /mnt/Finance
<alternative>
$mount -t cifs //192.168.1.1/Finance /mnt/Finance -o credentials=/path/credentialsfile
CredentialFile
Code: txt
username=plaintext
password=Password123
domain=.
Note: We need to install cifs-utils to connect to an SMB share folder. To install it we can execute from the command line sudo apt install cifs-utils.
-Once a shared folder is mounted, you can use common Linux tools such as find or grep to interact with the file structure. Let's hunt for a filename that contains the string cred:
\\Linux-Find
$find /mnt/Finance/ -name *cred*
$grep -rn /mnt/Finance/ -ie cred
\\Other service
FTP,TFTP,NFS that we can attach (mount) 
There are other file-sharing services such as FTP, TFTP, and NFS that we can attach (mount) using different tools and commands. However, once we mount a file-sharing service, we must understand that we can use the available tools in Linux or Windows to interact with files and directories. As we discover new file-sharing services, we will need to investigate how they work and what tools we can use to interact with them.

\\email 
SMNP delivery email through internet 
likewise protocol must be retrive an email from a service, POP3 and IMAP
We can use a mail client such as Evolution, the official personal information manager, and mail client for the GNOME Desktop Environment. We can interact with an email server to send or receive messages with a mail client. To install Evolution, we can use the following command:

\\Linux Install Evolution
$sudo apt-get install Evolution
Note: If an error appears when starting evolution indicating "bwrap: Can't create file at ...", use this command to start evolution export WEBKIT_FORCE_SANDBOX=0 && evolution.

\\Video - Connecting to IMAP and SMTP using Evolution
We can use the domain name or IP address of the mail server. If the server uses SMTPS or IMAPS, we'll need the appropriate encryption method (TLS on a dedicated port or STARTTLS after connecting). We can use the Check for Supported Types option under authentication to confirm if the server supports our selected method.

\\\Databases
Databases are typically used in enterprises, and most companies use them to store and manage information. There are different types of databases, such as Hierarchical databases, NoSQL (or non-relational) databases, and SQL relational databases. We will focus on SQL relational databases and the two most common relational databases called MySQL & MSSQL. We have three common ways to interact with databases:
1.	Command Line Utilities (mysql or sqsh)
2.	Programming Languages
3.	A GUI application to interact with databases such as HeidiSQL, MySQL Workbench, or SQL Server Management Studio.
\\Command Line Utilities
To interact with MSSQL (Microsoft SQL Server) with Linux we can use sqsh or sqlcmd if you are using Windows. Sqsh is much more than a friendly prompt. It is intended to provide much of the functionality provided by a command shell, such as variables, aliasing, redirection, pipes, back-grounding, job control, history, command substitution, and dynamic configuration. We can start an interactive SQL session as follows:

\\Linux - SQSH 
$sqsh -S 10.129.20.13 -U username -P Password123
The sqlcmd utility lets you enter Transact-SQL statements, system procedures, and script files through a variety of available modes:
At the command prompt.
In Query Editor in SQLCMD mode.
In a Windows script file.
In an operating system (Cmd.exe) job step of a SQL Server Agent job.

\\Window -SQL CMD
$>sqlcmd -S 10.129.20.23 -U username -P password

\\MySQL 
To interact with MySQL, we can use MySQL binaries for Linux (mysql) or Windows (mysql.exe). MySQL comes pre-installed on some Linux distributions, but we can install MySQL binaries for Linux or Windows using this guide. Start an interactive SQL Session using Linux:
\\Linux Mysql
[!bash!]$ mysql -u username -pPassword123 -h 10.129.20.13
GUI Application
To install dbeaver using a Debian package we can download the release .deb package from https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/releases and execute the following command:
Install dbeaver
[!bash!]$ sudo dpkg -i dbeaver-<version>.deb
Run dbeaver
[!bash!]$ dbeaver &
To connect to a database, we will need a set of credentials, the target IP and port number of the database, and the database engine we are trying to connect to (MySQL, MSSQL, or another).
