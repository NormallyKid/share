Introduction to Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks
Active Directory Explained
Why Should We Care About AD?
\\Real-World Examples
\\Scenario 1 - Waiting On An Admin
I used this access to drop SCF files around the shares and left Responder going. After a while, I got a single hit, the NetNTLMv2 hash of a user. I checked through the BloodHound output and noticed that this user was actually a domain admin! Easy day from here.
\\Scenario 2 - Spraying The Night Away
exercise great care not to lock out user accounts in the process. On one engagement, I found an SMB NULL session using the enum4linux tool and retrieved both a listing of all users from the domain, and the domain password policy. 
\\Scenario 3 - Fighting In The Dark
used the linkedin2username tool to first mashup potential usernames from the company's LinkedIn page. I combined this list with several username lists from the statistically-likely-usernames GitHub repo and, after using the userenum feature of Kerbrute, ended up with 516 valid users.
\\This Is The Way
-importance of iterative enumeration, understanding our target, and adapting and thinking outside the box as we work our way through an environment.

\\Practical Examples
\\Connecting via FreeRDP
$ xfreerdp /v:<MS01 target IP> /u:htb-student /p:Academy_student_AD!

\\Connecting via SSH
]$ ssh htb-student@<ATTACK01 target IP>

\\Tools of the Trade
Tool	Description
PowerView/SharpView	A PowerShell tool and a .NET port of the same used to gain situational awareness in AD. These tools can be used as replacements for various Windows net* commands and more. PowerView and SharpView can help us gather much of the data that BloodHound does, but it requires more work to make meaningful relationships among all of the data points. These tools are great for checking what additional access we may have with a new set of credentials, targeting specific users or computers, or finding some "quick wins" such as users that can be attacked via Kerberoasting or ASREPRoasting.
BloodHound	Used to visually map out AD relationships and help plan attack paths that may otherwise go unnoticed. Uses the SharpHound PowerShell or C# ingestor to gather data to later be imported into the BloodHound JavaScript (Electron) application with a Neo4j database for graphical analysis of the AD environment.
SharpHound	The C# data collector to gather information from Active Directory about varying AD objects such as users, groups, computers, ACLs, GPOs, user and computer attributes, user sessions, and more. The tool produces JSON files which can then be ingested into the BloodHound GUI tool for analysis.
BloodHound.py	A Python-based BloodHound ingestor based on the Impacket toolkit. It supports most BloodHound collection methods and can be run from a non-domain joined attack host. The output can be ingested into the BloodHound GUI for analysis.
Kerbrute	A tool written in Go that uses Kerberos Pre-Authentication to enumerate Active Directory accounts, perform password spraying, and brute-forcing.
Impacket toolkit	A collection of tools written in Python for interacting with network protocols. The suite of tools contains various scripts for enumerating and attacking Active Directory.
Responder	Responder is a purpose-built tool to poison LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS, with many different functions.
Inveigh.ps1	Similar to Responder, a PowerShell tool for performing various network spoofing and poisoning attacks.
C# Inveigh (InveighZero)	The C# version of Inveigh with a semi-interactive console for interacting with captured data such as username and password hashes.
rpcinfo	The rpcinfo utility is used to query the status of an RPC program or enumerate the list of available RPC services on a remote host. The "-p" option is used to specify the target host. For example the command "rpcinfo -p 10.0.0.1" will return a list of all the RPC services available on the remote host, along with their program number, version number, and protocol. Note that this command must be run with sufficient privileges.
rpcclient	A part of the Samba suite on Linux distributions that can be used to perform a variety of Active Directory enumeration tasks via the remote RPC service.
CrackMapExec (CME)	CME is an enumeration, attack, and post-exploitation toolkit which can help us greatly in enumeration and performing attacks with the data we gather. CME attempts to "live off the land" and abuse built-in AD features and protocols like SMB, WMI, WinRM, and MSSQL.
Rubeus	Rubeus is a C# tool built for Kerberos Abuse.
GetUserSPNs.py	Another Impacket module geared towards finding Service Principal names tied to normal users.
Hashcat	A great hash cracking and password recovery tool.
enum4linux	A tool for enumerating information from Windows and Samba systems.
enum4linux-ng	A rework of the original Enum4linux tool that works a bit differently.
ldapsearch	Built-in interface for interacting with the LDAP protocol.
windapsearch	A Python script used to enumerate AD users, groups, and computers using LDAP queries. Useful for automating custom LDAP queries.
DomainPasswordSpray.ps1	DomainPasswordSpray is a tool written in PowerShell to perform a password spray attack against users of a domain.

wmiexec.py	Part of the Impacket toolkit, it provides the capability of command execution over WMI.
Snaffler	Useful for finding information (such as credentials) in Active Directory on computers with accessible file shares.
smbserver.py	Simple SMB server execution for interaction with Windows hosts. Easy way to transfer files within a network.
setspn.exe	Adds, reads, modifies and deletes the Service Principal Names (SPN) directory property for an Active Directory service account.
Mimikatz	Performs many functions. Notably, pass-the-hash attacks, extracting plaintext passwords, and Kerberos ticket extraction from memory on a host.
secretsdump.py	Remotely dump SAM and LSA secrets from a host.
evil-winrm	Provides us with an interactive shell on a host over the WinRM protocol.
mssqlclient.py	Part of the Impacket toolkit, it provides the ability to interact with MSSQL databases.
noPac.py	Exploit combo using CVE-2021-42278 and CVE-2021-42287 to impersonate DA from standard domain user.
rpcdump.py	Part of the Impacket toolset, RPC endpoint mapper.

adidnsdump	A tool for enumerating and dumping DNS records from a domain. Similar to performing a DNS Zone transfer.
gpp-decrypt	Extracts usernames and passwords from Group Policy preferences files.
GetNPUsers.py	Part of the Impacket toolkit. Used to perform the ASREPRoasting attack to list and obtain AS-REP hashes for users with the 'Do not require Kerberos preauthentication' set. These hashes are then fed into a tool such as Hashcat for attempts at offline password cracking.
lookupsid.py	SID bruteforcing tool.
ticketer.py	A tool for creation and customization of TGT/TGS tickets. It can be used for Golden Ticket creation, child to parent trust attacks, etc.
raiseChild.py	Part of the Impacket toolkit, It is a tool for automated child to parent domain privilege escalation.
Active Directory Explorer	Active Directory Explorer (AD Explorer) is an AD viewer and editor. It can be used to navigate an AD database and view object properties and attributes. It can also be used to save a snapshot of an AD database for offline analysis. When an AD snapshot is loaded, it can be explored as a live version of the database. It can also be used to compare two AD database snapshots to see changes in objects, attributes, and security permissions.
PingCastle	Used for auditing the security level of an AD environment based on a risk assessment and maturity framework (based on CMMI adapted to AD security).
Group3r	Group3r is useful for auditing and finding security misconfigurations in AD Group Policy Objects (GPO).
ADRecon	A tool used to extract various data from a target AD environment. The data can be output in Microsoft Excel format with summary views and analysis to assist with analysis and paint a picture of the environment's overall security state.

\\Scenario
-We are Penetration Testers working for CAT-5 Security. After a few successful engagements shadowing with the team, the more senior members want to see how well we can do starting an assessment on our own. The team lead sent us the following email detailing what we need to accomplish.

\\Methods Used
-External Information Gathering (Passive Checks)
External information gathering is authorized to demonstrate the risks associated with information that can be gathered about the company from the internet. To simulate a real-world attack
-Internal Testing
The internal assessment portion is designed to demonstrate the risks associated with vulnerabilities on internal hosts and services ( Active Directory specifically) by attempting to emulate attack vectors from within Inlanefreight's area of operations.
. Testing will start from an anonymous position on the internal network with the goal of obtaining domain user credentials, enumerating the internal domain, gaining a foothold, and moving laterally and vertically to achieve compromise of all in-scope internal domains. Computer systems and network operations will not be intentionally interrupted during the test.

\\Password Testing
-Password files captured from Inlanefreight devices, or provided by the organization, may be loaded onto offline workstations for decryption and utilized to gain further access and accomplish the assessment goals
-All data will be stored securely on Cat-5 owned and approved systems and retained for a period of time defined in the official contract between Cat-5 and Inlanefreight.

NOTE:We provided the above scoping documentation so we become used to seeing this style of documentation. As we progress through our Infosec Careers, especially on the offensive side, it will be common to receive scoping documents and Rules of Engagement (RoE) documents that outline these types of information.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\==============================================
External Recon and Enumeration Principles
Validating information provided to you in the scoping document from the client
Ensuring you are taking actions against the appropriate scope when working remotely
Looking for any information that is publicly accessible that can affect the outcome of your test, such as leaked credentials
- we are trying to get the lay of the land to ensure we provide the most comprehensive test possible for our customer. That also means identifying any potential information leaks and breach data out in the worl
\
\What Are We Looking For?
Data Point	Description
IP Space	Valid ASN for our target, netblocks in use for the organization's public-facing infrastructure, cloud presence and the hosting providers, DNS record entries, etc.
Domain Information	Based on IP data, DNS, and site registrations. Who administers the domain? Are there any subdomains tied to our target? Are there any publicly accessible domain services present? (Mailservers, DNS, Websites, VPN portals, etc.) Can we determine what kind of defenses are in place? (SIEM, AV, IPS/IDS in use, etc.)
Schema Format	Can we discover the organization's email accounts, AD usernames, and even password policies? Anything that will give us information we can use to build a valid username list to test external-facing services for password spraying, credential stuffing, brute forcing, etc.
Data Disclosures	For data disclosures we will be looking for publicly accessible files ( .pdf, .ppt, .docx, .xlsx, etc. ) for any information that helps shed light on the target. For example, any published files that contain intranet site listings, user metadata, shares, or other critical software or hardware in the environment (credentials pushed to a public GitHub repo, the internal AD username format in the metadata of a PDF, for example.)
Breach Data	Any publicly released usernames, passwords, or other critical information that can help an attacker gain a foothold.

\\Where Are We Looking?
Resource	Examples
ASN / IP registrars	IANA, arin for searching the Americas, RIPE for searching in Europe, BGP Toolkit
Domain Registrars & DNS	Domaintools, PTRArchive, ICANN, manual DNS record requests against the domain in question or against well known DNS servers, such as 8.8.8.8.
Social Media	Searching Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook, your region's major social media sites, news articles, and any relevant info you can find about the organization.
Public-Facing Company Websites	Often, the public website for a corporation will have relevant info embedded. News articles, embedded documents, and the "About Us" and "Contact Us" pages can also be gold mines.
Cloud & Dev Storage Spaces	GitHub, AWS S3 buckets & Azure Blog storage containers, Google searches using "Dorks"
Breach Data Sources	HaveIBeenPwned to determine if any corporate email accounts appear in public breach data, Dehashed to search for corporate emails with cleartext passwords or hashes we can try to crack offline. We can then try these passwords against any exposed login portals (Citrix, RDS, OWA, 0365, VPN, VMware Horizon, custom applications, etc.) that may use AD authentication.

\\Finding Address Spaces
-The BGP-Toolkit hosted by Hurricane Electric is a fantastic resource for researching what address blocks are assigned to an organization and what ASN they reside within
-Understanding where that infrastructure resides is extremely important for our testing. 
-In some cases, your client may need to get written approval from a third-party hosting provider before you can test. Others, such as AWS, have specific guidelines for performing penetration tests and do not require prior approval for testing some of their services. Others, such as Oracle, ask you to submit a Cloud Security Testing Notification. 

\\DNS
DNS is a great way to validate our scope and find out about reachable hosts the customer did not disclose in their scoping document. Sites like domaintools, and viewdns.info are great spots to start
\\Viewdns.info

\\Public Data
-Ex:Sharepoint Admin Job Listing
-We can gather contact emails, phone numbers, organizational charts, published documents, etc. 
-These sites, specifically the embedded documents, can often have links to internal infrastructure or intranet sites that you would not otherwise know about
-Tools like Trufflehog and sites like Greyhat Warfare are fantastic resources for finding these breadcrumbs.
-. For a more detailed introduction to OSINT and external enumeration, check out the Footprinting and OSINT:Corporate Recon modules.

\\Overarching Enumeration Principles
- looking for every possible avenue we can find that will provide us with a potential route to the inside. Enumeration itself is an iterative process we will repeat several times throughout a penetration test
-first use passive resources, starting wide in scope and narrowing down. Once we exhaust our initial run of passive enumeration, we will need to examine the results and then move into our active enumeration phase.

\\Example Enumeration Process
Check for ASN/IP & Domain Data
-enumeration tactics on the inlanefreight.com domain without performing any heavy scans (such as Nmap or vulnerability scans which are out of scope). We will start first by checking our Netblocks data and seeing what we can find.
From this first look, we have already gleaned some interesting info. BGP.he is reporting:

IP Address: 134.209.24.248
Mail Server: mail1.inlanefreight.com
Nameservers: NS1.inlanefreight.com & NS2.inlanefreight.com
-For now, this is what we care about from its output. Inlanefreight is not a large corporation, so we didn't expect to find that it had its own ASN. Now let's validate some of this information.
\\Viewdns results
-In the request above, we utilized viewdns.info to validate the IP address of our target. Both results match, which is a good sign. Now let's try another route to validate the two nameservers in our results.
$nslookup ns1.inlanefreight.com
-We now have two new IP addresses to add to our list for validation and testing. Before taking any further action with them, ensure they are in-scope for your test. 
-For our purposes, the actual IP addresses would not be in scope for scanning, but we could passively browse any websites to hunt for interesting data. For now, that is it with enumerating domain information from DNS. Let's take a look at the publicly available information.
-Using filetype:pdf inurl:inlanefreight.com as a search, we are looking for PDFs.

\\Hunting For Files
\Hunting E-mail Addresses
Using the dork intext:"@inlanefreight.com" inurl:inlanefreight.com

\\E-mail Dork Results
-Browsing the contact page, we can see several emails for staff in different offices around the globe.
- We now have an idea of their email naming convention (first.last) and where some people work in the organization. This could be handy in later password spraying attacks or if social engineering/phishing were part of our engagement scope.

\\Username Harvesting
https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username
-We can use a tool such as linkedin2username to scrape data from a company's LinkedIn page and create various mashups of usernames (flast, first.last, f.last, etc.) that can be added to our list of potential password spraying targets.

\\Credential Hunting
https://dehashed.com/
-excellent tool for hunting for cleartext credentials and password hashes in breach data. We can search either on the site or using a script that performs queries via the API. Typically we will find many old passwords for users that do not work on externally-facing portals that use AD auth (or internal), but we may get lucky! This is another tool that can be useful for creating a user list for external or internal password spraying.
$ sudo python3 dehashed.py -q inlanefreight.local -p

Note: The script used in the example above can be found here. Due to changes in the API structure of DeHashed, modifications may be necessary. Alternatively, the following script could be used. Before executing the script, it is crucial to become familiar with its functionality.
https://github.com/mrb3n813/Pentest-stuff/blob/master/dehashed.py

<test>https://bgp.he.net/
$nslookup -type=TXT inlanefreight.com

\\\\\=====================================
Initial Enumeration of the Domain
\\Setting Up
A penetration testing distro (typically Linux) as a virtual machine in their internal infrastructure that calls back to a jump host we control over VPN, and we can SSH into.
A physical device plugged into an ethernet port that calls back to us over VPN, and we can SSH into.
A physical presence at their office with our laptop plugged into an ethernet port.
A Linux VM in either Azure or AWS with access to the internal network that we can SSH into using public key authentication and our public IP address whitelisted.
VPN access into their internal network (a bit limiting because we will not be able to perform certain attacks such as LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning).
From a corporate laptop connected to the client's VPN.
On a managed workstation (typically Windows), physically sitting in their office with limited or no internet access or ability to pull in tools. They may also elect this option but give you full internet access, local admin, and put endpoint protection into monitor mode so you can pull in tools at will.
On a VDI (virtual desktop) accessed using Citrix or the like, with one of the configurations described for the managed workstation typically accessible over VPN either remotely or from a corporate laptop.
-lient may also choose from a "grey box" approach where they give us just a list of in-scope IP addresses/CIDR network ranges, or "black box" where we have to plug in and do all discovery blindly using various techniques.
-Finally, they can choose either evasive, non-evasive, or hybrid evasive (starting "quiet" and slowly getting louder to see what threshold we are detected at and then switching to non-evasive testing
- They may also elect to have us start with no credentials or from the perspective of a standard domain user.
\\
A custom pentest VM within their internal network that calls back to our jump host, and we can SSH into it to perform testing.
They've also given us a Windows host that we can load tools onto if need be.
They've asked us to start from an unauthenticated standpoint but have also given us a standard domain user account (htb-student) which can be used to access the Windows attack host.
"Grey box" testing. They have given us the network range 172.16.5.0/23 and no other information about the network.
Non-evasive testing.
We have not been provided credentials or a detailed internal network map.
\\Tasks
Our tasks to accomplish for this section are:

Enumerate the internal network, identifying hosts, critical services, and potential avenues for a foothold.
This can include active and passive measures to identify users, hosts, and vulnerabilities we may be able to take advantage of to further our access.
Document any findings we come across for later use. Extremely important!

\\Key Data Points
Data Point	Description
AD Users	We are trying to enumerate valid user accounts we can target for password spraying.
AD Joined Computers	Key Computers include Domain Controllers, file servers, SQL servers, web servers, Exchange mail servers, database servers, etc.
Key Services	Kerberos, NetBIOS, LDAP, DNS
Vulnerable Hosts and Services	Anything that can be a quick win. ( a.k.a an easy host to exploit and gain a foothold)

\\TTPs
-Enumerating an AD environment can be overwhelming if just approached without a plan.
- abundance of data stored in AD, and it can take a long time to sift if not looked at in progressive stages, and we will likely miss things. We need to set a game plan for ourselves and tackle it piece by piece. 

\\Identifying Hosts
- Wireshark and TCPDump to "put our ear to the wire
-helpful if the assessment approach is "black box." We notice some ARP requests and replies, MDNS, and other basic layer two packet

\\Start Wireshark on ea-attack01
$sudo -E wireshark 

\\Wireshark Output
ARP packets make us aware of the hosts: 172.16.5.5, 172.16.5.25 172.16.5.50, 172.16.5.100, and 172.16.5.125.
MDNS makes us aware of the ACADEMY-EA-WEB01 host.
-If we are on a host without a GUI (which is typical), we can use tcpdump, net-creds, and NetMiner, etc., to perform the same functions.
-We can also use tcpdump to save a capture to a .pcap file, transfer it to another host, and open it in Wireshark.

\\Tcpdump Output
$sudo tcpdump -i ens224
-There is no one right way to listen and capture network traffic. There are plenty of tools that can process network data. Wireshark and tcpdump are just a few of the easiest to use and most widely known.
-pktmon.exe, which was added to all editions of Windows 10. As a note for testing, it's always a good idea to save the PCAP traffic you capture. You can review it again later to look for more hints, and it makes for great additional information to include while writing your reports.
-Responder is a tool built to listen, analyze, and poison LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS requests and responses. It has many more functions, 

\\Starting Repsonder
$sudo responder -I ens224 -a

-perform some active checks starting with a quick ICMP sweep of the subnet using fping.
-Fping provides us with a similar capability as the standard ping application in that it utilizes ICMP requests and replies to reach out and interact with a hos
 Where fping shines is in its ability to issue ICMP packets against a list of multiple hosts at once and its scriptability
 t works in a round-robin fashion, querying hosts in a cyclical manner instead of waiting for multiple requests to a single host to return before moving o

 \\FPing Active Checks
$fping -asgq 172.16.5.0/23
a to show targets that are alive, s to print stats at the end of the scan, g
 to generate a target list from the CIDR network, and q to not show per-target results.
-The command above validates which hosts are active in the /23 network and does it quietly instead of spamming the terminal with results for each IP in the target list
-Note: Scan results in the target network will differ from the command output in this section due to the size of the lab network. It is still worth reproducing each example to practice how these tools work and note down every host that is live in this lab.

\\Nmap Scanning
- identify critical hosts such as Domain Controllers and web servers, and identify potentially vulnerable hosts to probe later. 
$sudo nmap -v -A -iL hosts.txt -oN /home/htb-student/Documents/host-enum
-The -A (Aggressive scan options) scan will perform several functions. One of the most important is a quick enumeration of well-known ports to include web services, domain services, etc. For our hosts.txt file, some of our results from Responder and fping overlapped (we found the name and IP address), so to keep it simple, just the IP address was fed into hosts.txt for the scan.
$sudo nmap -A 172.16.5.100
 the -oA flag as a best practice when performing Nmap scans. This will ensure that we have our scan results in several formats for logging purposes and formats that can be manipulated and fed into other tools.
-Some of the Nmap scripted scans run active vulnerability checks against a host that could cause system instability or take it offline, causing issues for the customer or wors-running a large discovery scan against a network with devices such as sensors or logic controllers could potentially overload them and disrupt the customer's industrial equipment causing a loss of product or capability. Take the time to understand the scans you use before running them in a customer's environment.
-running a large discovery scan against a network with devices such as sensors or logic controllers could potentially overload them and disrupt the customer's industrial equipment causing a loss of product or capability. Take the time to understand the scans you use before running them in a customer's environment.

\\Identifying Users
-Obtaining a valid user with credentials is critical in the early stages of an internal penetration test. This access (even at the lowest level) opens up many opportunities to perform enumeration and even attacks. Let's look at one way we can start gathering a list of valid users in a domain to use later in our assessment.
-obtaining clear text credentials or an NTLM password hash for a user, a SYSTEM shell on a domain-joined host, or a shell in the context of a domain user account

\\Kerbrute - Internal AD Username Enumeration
-Kerbrute can be a stealthier option for domain account enumeration. It takes advantage of the fact that Kerberos pre-authentication failures often will not trigger logs or alerts. 
-We will use Kerbrute in conjunction with the jsmith.txt or jsmith2.txt user lists from Insidetrust. 
https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames
-This repository contains many different user lists that can be extremely useful when attempting to enumerate users when starting from an unauthenticated perspective. 

\\Cloning Kerbrute GitHub Repo
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute.git

\\Listing Compiling options
$make help
-We can choose to compile just one binary or type make all and compile one each for use on Linux, Windows, and Mac systems (an x86 and x64 version for each).

\\Compiling for Multiple Platforms and Architectures
$sudo make all
-The newly created dist directory will contain our compiled binaries.

\\Listing the Compiled Binaries in dist
$ls dist/
We can then test out the binary to make sure it works properly. We will be using the x64
 version on the supplied Parrot Linux attack host in the target environment.

\\Testing the kerbrute_linux_amd64 Binary
$ ./kerbrute_linux_amd64 
-We can add the tool to our PATH to make it easily accessible from anywhere on the host.

\\Adding the Tool to our Path
$echo $PATH

\\Moving the Binary
$sudo mv kerbrute_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/kerbrute
/home/htb-student/.local/bin:/snap/bin:/usr/sandbox/:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games:/usr/share/games:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/snap/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games:/home/htb-student/.dotnet/tools

We can now type kerbrute from any location on the system and will be able to access the tool. Feel free to follow along on your system and practice the above steps. Now let's run through an example of using the tool to gather an initial username list.

\\Enumerating Users with Kerbrute
$kerbrute userenum -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL --dc 172.16.5.5 jsmith.txt -o valid_ad_users
-We can see from our output that we validated 56 users in the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain and it took only a few seconds to do so. Now we can take these results and build a list for use in targeted password spraying attacks.

\\Identifying Potential vulnerabilities
-The local system account NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM is a built-in account in Windows operating systems. It has the highest level of access in the OS and is used to run most Windows services
-very common for third-party services to run in the context of this account by default. A SYSTEM account on a domain-joined host will be able to enumerate Active Directory by impersonating the computer account,
-which is essentially just another kind of user account. Having SYSTEM-level access within a domain environment is nearly equivalent to having a domain user account.
-There are several ways to gain SYSTEM-level access on a host, including but not limited to:
Remote Windows exploits such as MS08-067, EternalBlue, or BlueKeep.
Abusing a service running in the context of the SYSTEM account, or abusing the service account SeImpersonate privileges using Juicy Potato. This type of attack is possible on older Windows OS' but not always possible with Windows Server 2019.
Local privilege escalation flaws in Windows operating systems such as the Windows 10 Task Scheduler 0-day.

\\By gaining SYSTEM-level access on a domain-joined host, you will be able to perform actions such as, but not limited to:

Enumerate the domain using built-in tools or offensive tools such as BloodHound and PowerView.
Perform Kerberoasting / ASREPRoasting attacks within the same domain.
Run tools such as Inveigh to gather Net-NTLMv2 hashes or perform SMB relay attacks.
Perform token impersonation to hijack a privileged domain user account.
Carry out ACL attacks.

<test>From your scans, what is the "commonName" of host 172.16.5.5 ?
$nmap -A 172.16.5.5/24
<test>What host is running "Microsoft SQL Server 2019 15.00.2000.00"? (IP address, not Resolved name)

\\\\\\\\\\================================================
LLMNR/NBT-NS Posoning - from Linux
-We obtained some basic user and group information, enumerated hosts while looking for critical services and roles like a Domain Controller, and figured out some specifics such as the naming scheme used for the domain. In this phase, we will work through two different techniques side-by-side: network poisoning and password spraying.
-a Man-in-the-Middle attack on Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) broadcasts
- this attack may provide low-privileged or administrative level password hashes that can be cracked offline or even cleartext credentials. 

\\
LLMNR & NBT-NS Primer
-Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) are Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification that can be used when DNS fails. I
-If a machine attempts to resolve a host but DNS resolution fails, typically, the machine will try to ask all other machines on the local network for the correct host address via LLMNR. LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System (DNS) format 
-allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts. It uses port 5355 over UDP natively. If LLMNR fails, the NBT-NS will be used. NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name. NBT-NS utilizes port 137 over UDP.
-LLMNR/NBT-NS are used for name resolution, ANY host on the network can reply. This is where we come in with Responder to poison these requests. 
- poisoning effort is done to get the victims to communicate with our system by pretending that our rogue system knows the location of the requested hos
-. The captured authentication request can also be relayed to access another host or used against a different protocol (such as LDAP) on the same host. LLMNR/NBNS spoofing combined with a lack of SMB signing can often lead to administrative access on hosts within a domain. SMB Relay attacks will be covered in a later module about Lateral Movement.

\\Quick Example - LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning
Let's walk through a quick example of the attack flow at a very high level:

A host attempts to connect to the print server at \\print01.inlanefreight.local, but accidentally types in \\printer01.inlanefreight.local.
The DNS server responds, stating that this host is unknown.
The host then broadcasts out to the entire local network asking if anyone knows the location of \\printer01.inlanefreight.local.
The attacker (us with Responder running) responds to the host stating that it is the \\printer01.inlanefreight.local that the host is looking for.
The host believes this reply and sends an authentication request to the attacker with a username and NTLMv2 password hash.
This hash can then be cracked offline or used in an SMB Relay attack if the right conditions exist.

\\TTPs
- NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 are authentication protocols that utilize the LM or NT hash. We will then take the hash and attempt to crack them offline using tools such as Hashcat or John with the goal of obtaining the account's cleartext password to be used to gain an initial foothold or expand our access within the domain if we capture a password hash for an account with more privileges than an account that we currently possess.
-Several tools can be used to attempt LLMNR & NBT-NS poisoning:

Tool	Description
Responder	Responder is a purpose-built tool to poison LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS, with many different functions.
Inveigh	Inveigh is a cross-platform MITM platform that can be used for spoofing and poisoning attacks.
Metasploit	Metasploit has several built-in scanners and spoofing modules made to deal with poisoning attacks.
-Responder are great for establishing a foothold that we can later expand upon through further enumeration and attacks. Responder is written in Python and typically used on a Linux attack host, though there is a .exe version that works on Windows. Inveigh is written in both C# and PowerShell (considered legacy). Both tools can be used to attack the following protocols:
-LLMNR
DNS
MDNS
NBNS
DHCP
ICMP
HTTP
HTTPS
SMB
LDAP
WebDAV
Proxy Auth
Responder also has support for:

MSSQL
DCE-RPC
FTP, POP3, IMAP, and SMTP auth
