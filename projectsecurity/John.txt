===John the riper====

hashing plain text + hashfuction ( algorythm hahing) => hash / digest

====rainbow table is the wordlist that refer to hash value from that we can brute force password
by compare the hash 
ex of rainbow cat /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt | wc -l
==== fin algorithms
sordum hash generator
hashID python app
find hash algorithms => enter hash value

===========how does hash cracking work
So instead of trying to reverse the hash function, John uses a password list and puts that through the hash function and checks if the digest is equal to the digest found in the database (The rainbow table attack).

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt
Behind the scenes, John is executing the hash function for every password in rockyou.txt and comparing each digest with the digest in hash.txt
join --show hash.txt 
sudo john --format=Raw-MD5 --show hashtest.txt
===== crack the window password
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=NT window.txt
john --format=NT --show window.txt
