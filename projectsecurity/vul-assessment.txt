\\\\\\\=========================================
Security Assessments
network,computers and applications at least every so often.
purpose of most types of security assessments is to find and confirm vul are present -> can decide to patch, mitigate, removes
-some org have much more mature security posture than their peers and can focus on advanced red team simulations conducted by 3rd parties. 
while others are still working to etablish baseline security. Regardless, all org must stay on top of both legacy and recent vul and have a sys for detecting and mitigating risks to their sys and data
\\=================================================
Vulnerability Assessment
are appropriate for all org and network, its based on a particular security standard, and compli with these standards is analyzed 
(going through a checklist)
-its can be based on various secu standards, which standards apply to a particular network depend on many factors.
+industry-specific and regional data secu regulations, the size of a company network, which types of app they use or dev, and their security maturity level
VUl assess maybe performed independently or alongside other security assessment depending on an org situation
\\Penetration test
as with vul assessment, pentest can be used to improve a network secu. depend on org need
+network or infra pentester assess all aspects of computer network, including its networking device such as rounters and firewalls,
workstations, servers, and apps, ->require understand of networking, windows,Linux, AD, and at least one scripting language
+application pentesters assess web app, thick-client app, APIs, and mobile app. they will often be well-versed in source code review and able to assess a given web app from a black box or whitebox standpoint (typically a secure code review)
+network & infra pentester assess all aspects of a computer network including its networking devices such as rounters
and firewall, workstation,svr,app, -> need strong undestanding of networking,windows,linux,AD
network vul scanners, such as Nessus can be used alongside other tools during network pen, but network vul scaning is only
a part of a proper pen,
+evasion, non-evasion, hybrid evasion. Scanner tools only be used during a non-evasive pen -> to find as many flaws in network as possible.
-physical: physical security weakness and breakdowns in processes to gain access to a facility such as a data center or office building
-Social engineering pentester test human being: phishing, vishing,
before pentest is considered, there should be a track record of vul assessments and actions taken in response to vul assessment
\\Vulnerability Assessment vs Penetration tests
they are 2 diff assessments,
-Vulnerability assessments look for Vulnerability in network without simulating cyber attack. all comp should perform vul assessments every so often.
-a wide variety of security standards could be used for a Vulnerability assessment, such as GDPR compliance or OWASP web app security standards. a Vul assessment goes through a checklist
+ do we meet thiss standard? do we have this config ?
->During vul ass assessor will typically run scan and then perform validation on critical,high,medium risk vul
verify but will not seek to perform privilege escalation, lateral movement, post-exploitation, etc, if they are validate, EX a remote code execution vul
-Pentest depend on type, +manual +auto  it simulate cyber attack -> it should do after vul assessment and fix all issues
-> diff sorts of security test used in diff situation and one isn;t better
\\\\\\\====================================
Other types of security assessments.
\\security Audits
this diff from vul assess this are typically requirements from out side the org, and they;re typically mandated by goverment agencies or industry associations to assure that an org is compliant with specific security regulations.
PCI DSS,...
\\Bug bounties
\\Red team assessment
larger budgets and more resource require.
-a red team is type of evasive black box pentesting. simulating all kinds of cyber atk from the perspective of an external threat actor. this type have an end goal (reaching critical server or db)
->assessor only report the vul that led to the completion of goal not as many as possible-
- a red team should constantly be engaged in red teaming campaigns/
-campaigns could be based on new cyber exploits discovered through the actions of Advanced persistent threat group (APTs)
-ideally, if a company can afford it and has been building up its security maturity, it should conduct regular vul assessments on its own, contract third parties to perform pentest or red team assessments.and if approprite, build an internal red team to perform grey and whitebox pentesting with more specific paramter and scopes
\\Purple team assessment
A blue team consists of defensive security specialists, these are often people who work in a SOC or a CSIRT (computer security incident response team) often they have exprience with digital forensics too.
-> red + blue is Purple
- a blue team should start campaign "we need to improve our PCI DSS compliance -> red team point -of sale system -> blue team fix
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\======================================
Vul assessment
aims to identify and categorize risks for security weaknesses related to assets within an environment it is important to note tat there is little to no manual exploit during a vul assessment.
it also provides rememdiation steps to fix the issues
-> it help org identify the weak points, understand the risk level, calculate and prioritize rememdiation effort
\\Methodology
1. conduct risk identification and analysis
2 Develop Vulnerability scanning policies
3. identify the type of scans
4. Configure the scan
5. Perform the scan
6. evaluate and consider possible risks
7. interpret the scan results
8. Create A remediation & mitigation plain
\\Understanding Key Terms
\\Vulnerability 
is a weakness or bug in an org environement, include app, network, and infra, that open up the possible of threats from external actors.
-vul can be registerd thorugh MITRE's https://cve.mitre.org/
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator score to determne severity.
-score are cal using metrics such as the type of atk vectore (network,adjacent,localmphysical) atk complexity, privileges required, user interaction require, impact of successful exploit in an org confidential,integrity, availabilities ofdata
----Threat  +  Vulnerability  = risk
new incident potential harm system  + know weakness hacker could exploit = the potential for damnage when a threat exploits  a vul

\\threat is a process that amplifies the potential of an adverse event 
\\exploit any code or resource that can be used to take avantages of an asset weakness.
source: https://www.exploit-db.com/   https://www.rapid7.com/db/ or github gitlab as well
\\risk potential of assets or data being harmed or destroyed by threat actors

what is risk?
Risk is the effect of uncertainty on ojective ISO 31000
Uncertaint -> objects -> effect (is a positive or negative deviation from wat is expected )
no object no risk                       positive: opportunity  negative: threat

+Risk smt bad that could happen
+ Threat smt bad that is happening
+ Vulerabilities: weaknesses that could lead to a threat

\\Asset management
wnat to protect thing u must know exactly what protect
-once assets have been inventoried, then start the process of asset management. this is key concept in defensive security
\\Asset Inventory
critical component of vul management it should container
+infor tech, + Operational tech, +Physical. software, mobile, development assets.
-Org can utilize assets management tools to keep track of assets. the assets should have data classifications to ensure adequate security and access control
\\Application and system Inventory
should create a thorough and complete inventory of data assets for proper asset management for def security ,data assets include:
+all data stored on-premises, HDDs and SSDs in endpoints,..
+all data stored on the cloud provider possesses
+all data stored within various SAAS applications, this data is also "in the cloud" but might not all be within the scope of a corporate cloud provider account.
+all of the app a company needs to use to conduct their usual operationand biz
+all company on-prem computer networking devices
=> need to take time to assess everything, miss something = wont able to protect it
-any changes should reflect to data asset inventory
\\Assessment standard
both Pentest and vul assess should comply with specific standards to be accredited and accepted by goverments and legal authorities. such standards help ensure that the assessment is carried out thoroughly in a generally agreed-upon manner to increase the efficiency of these assessments and reduce the likelihood of and attack on org
\\Compliance standards
each regulatory compliance body has its own infor security standards that org must adhere to maintain their accreditation. the big compliance in infor security are
PCI, HIPAA, FISMA, and ISO 27001
-these accreditations are necessary because it certifies that an org has had a 3rd party vendor evaluates its enviro
.org also rely on these accreditations for biz operations since some companies wont do biz without specific accreditations from Org
\\Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
is commonly known standard in infor security that implements requirement for org that handle credit cards.
\\Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
used to protect patients data, HIPAA does not acessarily require vul scan or assessment.but risk assessment and vul identification are required to maintain HIPAA accreditation
\\Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)
is a set of standards and guidelines used to safeguard goverment operations and infor
\\ISO 27001
used standard worldwide to manage infor security it requires org to perform quarterly external and internal scans
-> <interest>
the international Organization for standardization (ISO) maintain tech standards for pretty much anything you can imagine. the ISO 27001 standard deals with infor security/
ISO  27001 compliance depends upon maintaining an effective infor security management system. to ensure compliance, organizations can perform penetration tests in a carefully designed way.
\\Penetration testing standards
shoulld be performed with rules or guidelines. there must always be a specifically defined scope for pentest
the owner sign legal contract with pentesters. outline what theyre allowed what not.
must be get rid of, modify data, harm system, EX try to proof by screening
\\Some pentest standard
+PTES Penetration testing execution standard can be applied to all types of pentest. it outlines the phases of pentest and how they should be conducted.
    + Pre-engagement Interactions 
    + Intelligence Gathering
    + Threat Modeling
    + Vulnerability analysis
    + exploitation
    + Post exploit
    + Reporting
-OSSTMM Open source security testing Methodology manual
    +Human security (social engineering exploits)
    +Physical security
    +Wireless comm (including and not limited to tech like wifi and bluetooth)
    +Telecommunications
    +Data networks
-nist national institute of standard and technology
this design incident response policies and precedures. NIST also has a pentest framework.
    +Planning
    +Discovery
    +Attack
    +Reporting
-OWASP Open Web Application Security Project 
they're typically the go-to org for defining testing standards and classifying risks to web app
-OWASP maintains a few diff standards and helpful guides for assessing various technologies"
    + Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG) https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/

\\\\\\\\\\\=========================================================
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
use for calculations the severity of vul   https://www.first.org/cvss/
-important must undestan how these scores are derived in case ever need to cal one by hand or justify the score applied to a given vul
-CVSS is often used together with the so-called Microsoft DREAD. DREAD is a risk assessment system dev by microsoft to help IT evaluate the severity of security threats and vul.
-we calculate the risk of a threat or vul based on five main factors
    +damage potential
    +Reproducibility
    +explotability
    +Affected Users
    +Discoverability
-> this model is essential to MS security strategy,it also serves as a reference for IT security professional and managers to perform their risk assessment and prioritization security threat and vuln
\\Severity Scoring
-the CVSS system helps categorize the severity associated with an issue and allow org to prioritize issues base on the rating.
-it consists of the exploitability and impact of an issue. the exploitability measurement consist of 
access vector, access complexity, and authentication. the impact metrics consists of the CIA triad, including
Confidentality, integrity, and availability
https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/media/MetricGroups.svg

\\Getting started with Nessus
https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?loginAttempted=true
->request free license: https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/activation-code
\\installing package
$dpkg -i Nessus-8.15.1-ubuntu910_amd64.deb
\\Starting Nessus
$sudo systemctl start nessusd.service
\\Accessing Nessus
$ https://localhost:8834 -> select Nessus essentials for the free version, and then enter activation code:
-> setup with a password for nessus acc. then the plugins will begin to compile once this step completed:
NOTE: the VM provided at the Nessus skills assessment section has Nessus pre-installed and the targets running. go to that section and start the VM and Nessus throughout the module, which can be accessed at 
https://<ip>:8834. the Nessus credentials are: htb-student:HTB_@cademy_student!
also use these credential to SSH into the target VM to config Nessus
->start creating scans, scan policies, plugin rules, and customizing settings.
the settings page has a wealth of options such as settingup a proxy server or SMTP server. standard account management options and advanced setting to customize the user interface, scaning loging perform secu option
\\Nessus Scan 
-> New scan. select scan type, scan template fall into 3 cate: Discovery, Vul, and Compliance.
\\New Scan
option for Host Discovery scan to identify live hosts/open ports or a variety of scan types such as the
+Basic Network Scan, Advanced Scan, Malware scan, Web Application Tests, awa scans targeted at specific CVEs and audit & compliance standards. 
https://docs.tenable.com/nessus/Content/ScanAndPolicyTemplates.htm
-> try basic netowrk scan option 
\\Discovery
-> Discovery section, under Host Discovery, we're presented with the option to enable scanning for fragile devices. Scanning devices such as network printers often result in them printing out reams of paper wit garbage text leavin the devices unusable.-> disable
->port scan
-withing the service discovvery subsection -> probe all ports to find services option is selected by default.
-> it's possible that a poorly designed app or service could crash as a result of tis probing, but most app should be robust enough to handle this.
-searching for SSL/TKS services is also enabled by default on a custom scan. and Nessus can additionally be instructed to identify expiring and revoked certificates
\\Assessment
->under assessment, web app scanning can also be enabled if required, and custom user agent and various other web app scanning options can be specified (eg URL for remote file inclusion (RFI))
-if desired, Nessus can attempt to authen against app and service using provided credentials (if running a credential scan) or else can perform a brute-force attack with the provided user name ans pasword list
-user enum can also be performed using various tech such as RID brute forcing:
-if we plan to perform RID brute forcing, we can set the Starting and ending UIDs for both domain and local user acc
\\Advanced
\\scan polcicies
gave us the ability to create targeted  scans for any number of scenarios, such as a slower, more evasive scan, a web-focused scan, or a scan for a particular client using one or several sets of credetnail. scan polcicy 
\\Creating a scan policy 
->New Policy ->scan basic network scan then customize it. or create our own. 
-> Advanced Scan to create a fully customized scan with no pre-config recommendation built-in
->from here we can config settings, add in any necessary credentials, and specify any compliance standards to run the scan against. we can also choose to enable or disable entire plusin families or individual plugins
https://docs.tenable.com/nessus/Content/Plugins.htm
once done -> save
\\Nessus Plugins
-Nessus works with plugins written in the Nessus Attack Scripting Language (NASL) and can target new vulnerability and CVEs
-the plugins contain information such as the vul name, impact, remediation, and away to test for the presence of a particular issue
-Plugins are rated by severity level: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info. At the time of tis writing Tenable has published 145,973 plugins that cover 58391 CVE IDs and 30696 Bugtraq IDs, a searchable db of all published plugins is on the Tenable website
-plugins tab provides more infor on a particular detection, including mitigation. when conducting recurring scans, there may be a vul/detection that. upon further examination. is not considered to be an issue.
EX MS DirectAccess (a allows insecure and null cipher suites)
$sslscan example.com
to create exclude for get rid of false positive 
-under Resources section -> select Plugin Rules. in the new plugin rule, input the host to be excluded, along with the plugin ID for Microsoft DirectAccess, and specify the action to be performed as Hide this result:
-also can exclude certain issues from scan results, such as plugins for issues that are not directly exploitable (e.g SSL, self-signed Certificate.) do this by specifying the plugin ID and hosts to be excluded:
\\Scanning with credentials
Nessus also support credential scanning and provides a lot of flexibility by supporting LM/NTLM hashes. kerberos authentication and password authentication.
-credentials ca be configured for host-based authen via SSH with a password, public key, certificate, or kerberote-based authen. it can also be configured for Windows host-based authen with a password kerberos, LM hash, or NTLM hash:
-it also supports authen for a variety of db types including Oracle, PostgreSQL, DB2, MySQL, SQL server, MongoDB, Sysbase:
NOTE: to run a credentialed scan on the target, use the following credentials: htb-student_adm:HTB_@academy_student! for linux
and administrator:Academy_VA_adm1! for Windows. these scan have already been setup in the Nessus target to save time
-in addition to that, Nessus can perform plaintext authen to services such as FTP,HTTP,IMAP,IPMI,Telnet, more
-check the out put
\\Working with Nessus Scan Output
nessus provide variety of report formats as well as the option to export raw Nessus scan result to be imported into other tools, archived, or passed to tools, 
such as EyeWitness,https://github.com/RedSiege/EyeWitness
which can be used to take scre shot of all web app identified by nessus and greatly assist us with working thoruh the results and finnding more value
\\Nessus repositories
.pdf .html or .csv 
the summary report provides a listing of hosts, a total number of vul discovered per host, and a show details option to see the severity CVSS score. plugin number, and name of each discovered issue.
NOTE: these scan reports should only be shared as either an appendix or supplementary data to a custom pentest /vul  assessment report. they should not be given to a client as the final deliverable for any assessment type.
- it is best to always make sure the vul are grouped together for a clear understanding of each issue and the assets Affected
\\Exporting Nessus scans
scan.nessus or scan.db / nessus file is an .xml file and includes a copy of the scan settings and plugin outputs. 
the .db file contains the .nessus file and the scan''s KB, plugin Audit Trail, and any scan attachments, more infor about the KB and Audit Trail can be found
https://community.tenable.com/s/article/What-is-included-in-a-nessus-db-file
-Scripts such as the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eelsivart/nessus-report-downloader/master/nessus6-report-downloader.rb
can be used to quickly download scan result in all available format fro the CLI using the Nessus REST API:
$./nessus_downloader.rb
\\Scanning issues
scan can cause issues on sensitive networks and provide false positives, no results, or have an unfavorable impact on the network, it is always best to comm with client for internal stakeholders if running a scan against network.on whether any sensitive/legacy hosts should be excluded from the scan or if any high priority /high availability hosts should be scanned separately, outside of regular business hours, or with different scan configuration to avoid potential issues.
-these are also times when a scan may return unexpected results and need to be fine-tuned
\\Mitigating issues
-some firewall will cause scan result showing either all ports open or no port open -> ty o disable the Ping the remote host option
- in sensitive network, we can use rate-limiting to minimize impact.
EX: we can adjust Performance Options and modify Max Concurrent Checks Per Host if the target Host is often under heavy load, such as widely used web app.this will limit the number of plugins used concurrently against the host
- avoid scanning legacy systems and choose the option not to scan printers, as we showed ealier section.
if a hosts of particular concern, it should be left out of the target scope or we can use the nessusd.rules file to configure Nessus scans.
https://login.tenable.com/login?state=hKFo2SBGak43T2dpVndwd2l3RE9SQ0t5LVlsXy1nNEo5eWFtdqFupWxvZ2luo3RpZNkgYUdIZnFjUkJIMmRzUkRBMUN3b1cwZnktYzlKV1dHNGOjY2lk2SBncllIbUkyUnRVa291NmVlZU5VSjNLV3p4NVM1cGI2Qw&client=grYHmI2RtUkou6eeeNUJ3KWzx5S5pb6C&protocol=samlp&connection=Username-Password-Authentication
-unless specifically requested we should never perform DOS check. we can ensure that these types of plugins are not used by always enabling the "safe checks"https://www.tenable.com/blog/understanding-the-nessus-safe-checks-option
when performing scans to avoid any network plugins that can have a negative impact on a target. such as crashing a network deamon. enabling the "safe check"tnot garantee 10% safe but minimize the impact
-alert client and request for necessary personal before starting scan. when scan is completed, we should keep detailed logs of the scanning activity in case an  incident occurs that must be investigated
\\Network impact
-keep inmind the potential impact of vul scanning on a network, especially on low bandwidth or congested links . 
this can be measured using vnstat:
$sudo apt install vnstat
let monitor the eth0 network adapter before running a Nessus scan:
$sudo vnstat -l -i eth0
-> we can compare this result with the result we get when monitoring the same interface during a nessus scan against just one host
\\Scanning issues
few best practices should be taken into consideration before starting a scan, 
+ scan can cause on sensitive networks and provide false positives/unfavorable impact on the network
+ it is best to comm with client on whether an sensitive/legacy hosts should be excluded from the scan or if any high priority/high availability host should be scanned separately, outside of regular business hours. or with diff scan config to avod potential issues.
+ also times when a scan may return unexpected results and need to be fine-tuned
\\Mitigating issues
+firewall cause us to receive scan results showing either all ports open or no ports open
->config advanced scan and disable ping the remote host option
+in sensitive networks, use rate limit to minimize impact. ex: adjust Performance Options and modify Max Concurrent Checks Per Host if the target host is often under heavy load, such as a widely used web app this will limit the number of plugins used concurrently against the host
+avoid scanning legacy sys and choose the option not to scan printers.if a host is particular concern. it should be left out of the target scope or we can use the nessusd.rules file to configure Nessus scans, more infor about it can find
https://community.tenable.com/s/article/What-is-the-Nessus-rules-file?language=en_US
+never perform DOS  chec if there are no specificaly requested -> always enabling safe check
<test>10.129.202.116

Getting Started with OpenVAS
vulnerability scanner. Greenbone Networks has an entire Vulnerability Manager. part of which is OpenVas scanner
_grennbone vul manager is also open to the public and free. 
OpenVAS has capabilities to perform network scans, including authenticated and unauthenticated testing
\\installing package
$sudo apt-get update && apt-get -y full-upgrade
$sudo apt-get install gvm && OpenVas
-> $gvm-setup (this take about 30mins)
$gvm-start
access OpenVAS by https://<ip>:8080 cred htb-student HTB_@cademy_student! (this also SSH cred of remote VM)
\\Configurations
before setting up any scans, it best to configure the target for the scan. navigate to the configurations tab -> select Target 
-> free to config for ports, authentication and methods of identifying if the host is reachable. for the alive test, the scan config default option from OpenVAS leverages the NVT Ping Host in the NVT Family.
https://docs.greenbone.net/GSM-Manual/gos-22.04/en/scanning.html#creating-a-target
-typically, an authen scan leverages a high priviledged user such as root or administrator. 
->once target set it ready for scan
\\Setting Up a scan
Multi scan config leverages OpenVAS Network Vul test (NVT) families, such consist many diff categories of vul, such as ones for windows, linux web app,etc.
+base: status of host, OS , (not include vul scan)
+Discovery: enum infor about the system, identifies host services, hardware, accessible ports, software being used on the sys, (not including check vul)
+Host discovery: solely tests whether the host is alive and determines what devices are active on the network. leverages ping to identify if the host is alive (not include check vul)
+System Discovery: enum the target host further than the discovery scan and attempts to identify the OS and hardware associated with the host
+Full and fast:safest option and leverages intelligence to use the best NVT checks for the host(s) based on the accessible ports.
->navigate scans ->wizard ->config scan -> input target -> scan

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\========================================
Reporting
critical aspect of role, report should be readable by anyone ranging from a technical person to a non-technical person. 
+ A strong report consists of the following sections:
    + Executive summary
    + Overview of Assessment
    + Scope
    + Vulnerabilities and Recommendations
\\Executive summary
intended to be readable by an executive who needs a high-level overview of the details and what is the most important items to fix immediately, depending on the severity. This section allows an executive to look at the report and prioritize remediations based on the summary
\\Overview of Assessment
include any methodology leveraged during the assessment, the methodology should detail the execution of the assessment during the testing period. such as discussing the process and tools used for the project (e.g Nessus)
\\Scope and Duration
should include everything the client authorized for the assessment, including the target scope and the testing period
\\Vulnerabilities and Recommendations
should detail the findings discovered during vul assess once eliminated any false positives by mnually testing them,
it is best to group finding that relate to each other based on type of issues or their severity
-each issue should have following elements:
    +Vul name
    +CVE
    +CVSS
    +Description of issue
    + References
    + Remediation steps
    + Proof of concept
    + Affected SYsmtems

=> The strongest reports are concise and clear for a reader
